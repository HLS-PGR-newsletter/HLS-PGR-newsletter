## Feedback

If you have any feedback about the email, website or content that you would like to give to the volunteers currently working on the newsletter, please email [Sarah Charles](cov.pgrnewsletter+feedback@gmail.com).

## Submission guidelines

There is a lot of flexibility over what you can submit. For example, it could be a short thinkpiece on a topic you know well, or it could be a piece of health and wellbeing advice that you feel is important for PhD students. If you are interested in writing a piece for the newsletter or want your study advertising, read and follow the submission guidelines.

### Health and wellbeing

If you would like to write an article about health and wellbeing as a post-graduate, please email [Danii Chippett](cov.pgrnewsletter+hnw@gmail.com).

### Reflections

If you would like to write a reflective piece about your time as a post-graduate, please email [Becky Seymour](cov.pgrnewsletter+reflections@gmail.com).


### Thinkpieces

A Thinkpiece is an article that provides you with analysis, or discussion about a specific topic that is both factual and contains personal opinions. It differs from a reflection in that you do not have to have personally had an experience that you think others are going to relate to. It just needs to be a piece about something that you feel people should know more about - like an opinion piece. [James Bartlett](cov.pgrnewsletter@gmail.com) collates the Thinkpieces that we receive. 

### Researcher spotlight

There are a lot of post-graduates studying many topics in the HLS faculty. You might not even know everyone in your own department or research centre. We designed this section so that we can get to know more postgraduates across HLS and learn about their research. If you would like to be put under our spotlight, please email [Sarah Charles](cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) and answer the following questions:

- What is your thesis title (or working title)?
- In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis for dummies?
- Why did you choose your thesis topic?
- Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your PhD?
- What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?

### Research participation

As post-graduate researchers, we are always on the look out for participants. However, we could probably help each other out more than often than we normally do. If you would like your study advertising, please email the following information to [James Bartlett](cov.pgrnewsletter+researchptps@gmail.com):

- Study title
- Study topic (what is the general topic of the study?)
- Researcher (who is the lead researcher and what is their email?)
- Inclusion criteria (are you looking for particular kinds of participants?)
- Study type (face to face or online)
- Estimated study length
- Survey link or contact information
- Ethical approval reference (this can be found on your ethics certificate)
- Closing date of study (when are planning on ending data collection?)
