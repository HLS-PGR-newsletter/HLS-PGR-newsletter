PhD students can fall into the trap of feeling you have work 24/7. However, for the good of yourself and your PhD, it is important to regularly have time to yourself! Be sure to join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HLSsocials) to stay up to date with all our upcoming social events.
