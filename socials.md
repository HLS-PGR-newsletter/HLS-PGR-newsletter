PhD students can fall into the trap of feeling you have work 24/7. However, for the good of yourself and your PhD, it is important to regularly have time to yourself! Be sure to join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HLSsocials) to stay up to date with all our upcoming social events.

# Upcoming Events:

## 17th April 2018, 5:30 pm - PGR dinner at PGR,

We have planned a food social for post-graduate research students - If you're interested in wood-oven pizzas and want to meet some fellow research students, please come along.

## 23 April 2018, 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm - Does the Dog read to the child?

This event was not arranged by PGR students, but is being held at the phoenix and all students are welcome!

The main focus of the event is to look at the question 'how can we engage children with reading for enjoyment?'
