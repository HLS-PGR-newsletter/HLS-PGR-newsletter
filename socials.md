PhD students can fall into the trap of feeling you have work 24/7. However, for the good of yourself and your PhD, it is important to regularly have time to yourself! Be sure to join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HLSsocials) to stay up to date with all our upcoming social events.

# Upcoming Events:


## Wednesday 13th February - Board Games Evening

**Venue** - Refectory, Elm Bank.

**Time**: 17:00  - ~20:00.

This event will have any students who show up play board games. Anyone can come along: from a casual gamer who has only ever played Monopoly or Snakes and Ladders all the way to more regular board gamers.

Bring your own games along, and play with others.

Current games we know are being brought:

* [Wibbell++](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180845/wibbell) - A silly set of card games that can be played by 2-15 players. (time per game ~ 10-20 minutes)
* [Legendary: Buffy The Vampire Slayer Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/210290/legendary-buffy-vampire-slayer) - A co-operative deck-building game where you each take your same starter deck and improve it across the game to help take out a 'Big Bad' (time per game ~ 60-75 minutes)
