## Research Funds

Reminder that the date that this fund (£250FT, £125 PT) expires is 31st July

It is important that we take advantage of these funds, as the university may end up taking it away if we aren't using it

## Ethics and GDPRs

The ethics committee are in the process of updating their guidelines to prepare us for the GDPRs

## Next Forum

Finally, if you have any concerns that you wish your REPS to raise, please contact them before the next forum on the 6th June.
