Though Post Graduate research dissertations come in all shapes and sizes depending on the discipline in which they are written, methodology and institutional regulations, there is one feature that is universal, which is, they need to have a clear thesis statement. The term ‘thesis’ has Greek roots meaning "a proposition," or "a formulation in advance of a proposition to be proved” ([Online Etymology Dictionary, n.d.](https://www.etymonline.com/word/thesis)). In more straight forward language, the thesis statement is the main argument that is being presented in your dissertation; It is the very essence of the thesis that may be as much as 80,000 worlds long.

To start, a distinction needs to be made between presenting an ‘argument’ and ‘being argumentative’. Going back to ancient Greek, the latter form is associated with the ‘Sophist’ tradition. The Sophists were a group of philosophers who were adept at mobilising the power oratory to make ‘sophisticated’ arguments. However, they were criticised by Platonic philosophers who felt that, rather like the politicians of today, their arguments were rhetorical and lacking any substance; they were offering nothing more than a form of ‘antilogic’.  Rather than being interested in the truth, Plato felt that the Sophists were merely interested in silencing an opponent, either by making their position appear self-contradictory, or simply negating any proposition put forward in debate. ([Kerferd, 2017](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sophist-philosophy)).

Whilst, completing a thesis no doubt requires skilful writing, whereby sophisticated arguments can be developed, the key point is that the author’s motivation is not to enter in a battle or words with the aim of negating a position. The primary aim of the writer should be to set out and defend a proposition. In this regard the ‘thesis statement’ should lay out very clearly the context, scope and aim of the thesis. There are no hard and fast rules about the length of the thesis statement, but it should not normally exceed more than one paragraph, otherwise it will begin to lose its purpose, which is to capture the essence of the dissertation. The scope of the thesis statement, particularly so at doctoral level, should be sufficiently ambitious to suggest something original and novel is being proffered, but at the same time, realistic and clearly defined such that it can be established within the boundaries of the dissertation and time-scale of a research degree.

Having established what a thesis is, the next challenge is to develop one. In this regard, though your interest in a subject may have arisen from a question. However, as alluded to earlier, a thesis itself is never a question, but a proposition. It requires some substance or argument/polemic that can be defended, and so a thesis is a demonstration of position. For the same reason, you should not present your thesis as a list of simple statements that may be the stating the obvious. For example, a thesis statement along the following lines is meaningless. “The crisis of neoliberalism, as evidenced by the 2008 banking collapse, is related to a range of political, social and economic factors”. Such a statement really does not advance any new thinking, nor will it be of much interest to a reader.

And so, it is important to be as specific as possible when making a thesis statement, including ensuring any central concepts that you will be exploring in the dissertation are situated in it. Whilst the statement needs to be challenging this does not mean moralistic, combative and confrontation, as this can appear to be both vague and polemical. Hence, avoid emotive words which may be open to different meanings, e.g. “neoliberalism is an ‘evil’ ideology…”. In contrast, the thesis statement should have a clearly defined and arguable claim, e.g. “Though neoliberal policies appear to have enabled the acceleration of wealth creation in developing countries, we have also seen overall increases in inequalities and considerable environmental costs”. This thesis statement makes a definite, arguable claim that entices the reader to want to see how the author will be further elaborating and substantiating their claim.

To conclude, it is important to be as specific and clear as possible when framing a thesis statement. Think of it as a kind of sales pitch - though in comparison to Dragons Den, it may appear quite boring - where you are seeking out investors in a product that you feel will change the world in any number of ways. They want to know what you are proposing and why it is important and whether there is anything new to offer.
