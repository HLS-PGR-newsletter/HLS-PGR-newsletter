In preparation for my PGRes Bite Size Workshop on “*Writing up and developing voice*,” I approached a number of colleagues across campus and asked them to share their thoughts on the topic, and how they have worked to ‘find their voice’ in their writing. This piece will hopefully shed some light on the fact that not every academic has the same voice, nor is there a single correct way of finding your own voice.


Permission has been given for me to share all the responses below. I encourage you to read them, and to think about what your response would be.

I’m uncomfortable with writing (or reading) very academic language, and so my writing voice is fairly similar to the way I speak. I think finding your voice comes with practice - the more you write, the more you sound like ‘yourself’. I am someone who tends to ‘think to write’ - I do a lot of thinking and planning before ever putting pen to paper or finger to keyboard, and then do relatively little editing. Casual questioning of colleagues suggests that more people tend to ‘write to think’ - putting a lot of words down and then editing them until they are satisfied.
I think, read and plan for a long time (and during my PhD, this was usually approximately the length of time that it took for my supervisor to develop a mild twitch), and then I write. I tend not to edit very much; I think I do a lot of the refining of my writing in my head, before I actually start. (And it’s a real pleasure to look back at something I wrote weeks or months or years ago, and think, “Oh, that’s quite good, actually!”.)

Gaining confidence and being critical in your writing take practice. The more you research, review and synthesise resources related to your work, you will begin to craft your own original thoughts and situate your work amongst others in the specific domain(s).

Developing my voice was a difficult thing to do. I work in a sensitive and politically charged area (the representations of refugees) so I initially found it hard to know where empirical evidence ended and when my own opinion on the matter began. As a result of this, at first I think I was more likely to play it safe and make sure that I wasn’t merely stating my own opinion. However, as I learned more about my topic, and started to build my own arguments based on my own empirical findings, I’ve been able to grow in confidence to the point that I’m much more willing to be bolder in claiming, for example, that refugees are treated badly and that the system they encounter does them harm. Perhaps if the evidence was less compelling this would have been harder. As I’ve been able to build my own body of research, I’ve also felt more confident in stating my claims. Owning your work is extremely important, so it’s well worth striving towards this. Make sure that all the claims you make can be supported with evidence, but as long as you can do this, you should be as bold as you can in making your claims.

Threshold concepts and action research really appealed to me, so I built ‘my voice’ around those two major educational themes, with a strong emphasis on reflective practice and the engagement of students as partners. I also try and merge my “expert students’” voices with my voice, though a threshold-concepts-informed role-reversal model.


* **Janneke Adema, Research Fellow Digital Media**, *Centre for Postdigital Cultures, School of Media and Performing Arts*

I have always found the idea of ‘finding one’s own voice’ when writing quite problematic, as it presumes an individual, original, liberal, humanist author, where it is this figure which I have always tried to critique and problematise in my work. I have done so in an affirmative manner by experimenting with, among others, remix, re-use, copying, personas, anonymous writing, collaborative, distributed, ghost, patch, and communal forms of writing. For me it is important that we acknowledge the various (material and discursive, human and posthuman) agencies at play in our writing, that we emphasise neglected readings or dissonant voices, that we provide space for the voices of the oppressed, where it is all of these voices, as Paul D. Miller so eloquently states, ‘who speak through you’ (Rhythm Science 2004, 037).


* **Julia Carroll, Professor in Child Development and Education**, *HLS*

I think the first thing was that I wrote a lot, not just for assessed work or deadlines, but my undergraduate degree required weekly short essays which were discussed in tutorials rather than assessed, so I had a lot of (sometimes painful) experience of explaining or defending what I had written. When I started my PhD I continued to write blocks of text about what I had read – I used writing almost to make sense of what I had read.
Two things which my PhD supervisor said that stuck with me were about a research paper ‘telling a story’ and about the extent to which you believe in your own findings. Humans want to hear stories, even in quantitative research papers. If you know what story you want to tell, then it is a lot easier for the writer and the reader. On the other hand, you should never stretch the data to fit the story. If the data doesn’t really fit then you need to be honest with yourself and change the story – that’s the difference between research and other kinds of writing I think. That said, I hate reading back what I have written! I’m never completely happy with it.


* **Federica Jorio, Senior PGT Coordinator**, *Post Graduate Strategy Unit*

I struggled during my doctoral path because I was not confident enough to make a stance for at least two years. A serendipitous moment happened, while sitting in the library reading random books, as well as talking to peers: I found out I wanted more than the epistemology I was offered by my supervisor, which was at that moment only a starting point, not the way to proceed – not my method. I needed to visualise my framework first, since my research wanted to investigate others' frameworks, namely the epistemology of knowledge of future professionals in education and social work.
So, what to do when you find yourself alone, and everything you worked on is now behind you? You read more, you ask more, you talk more to people in the academia, you send emails, you google keywords and see where they take you. You start back, and think about the past as a huge warming-up process for the actual research project. I allowed myself the privilege of wandering and simultaneously of being stuck. I started keeping a log, a diary that ultimately offered me the narrative of my methodological approach in research. I actually wrote the auto-ethnography of my method as a struggling young researcher. The log showed a non-linear approach to contents, to theories, to authors, to methods, to data and yet it was a clear grasp, a picture of “an” approach.

Auto-ethnography on one hand, and etymology on the other, offered me the way to recompose the research project I completed and yet I could not present in a written form. I went back to images behind and beyond words: I searched for the metaphor which could reveal “the pattern that connects”. I waited for the image to come to my eyes, as a composition of thoughts that could help me find the structure, a way to scaffold the writing and the understanding of the whole research journey I was experiencing. The image, the metaphor I looked for, or, my attempt to waited to emerge from the magma I was surrounded by, was meant to be my understanding and representation of my approach to knowledge – my epistemology.
My research, by the way, implied the use of cinema as metaphor to reveal students' epistemologies, so I applied the same premise to myself: let the image tell you something about your vision, your eyes, your grasp on reality and your approach to knowledge itself. The image arisen was a mushroom, or to be more precise, a group of mushrooms which bloom near each other, and which are single elements on the visible side, and yet are a network, a single living being underground, in the soil. This was the shape of my research: apparently disconnected elements linked instead by a multifaceted theory, a hybrid methodology, a brave approach in communicating both of them. Like the mushrooms, all connected in a complex invisible network that lies underneath, my epistemology was waiting to be acknowledged by myself. I found my voice in the roots of the mushrooms. I found the patterns between authors, theories, methods which were already there, but were invisible until I found “the metaphor my research lived by”.


* **Eline Kieft, Research Associate**, *Dance Researcher, C-DARE*

English is not my first language. This requires a translation of ways of thinking and constructing sentences, conveying meaning and intentions through a different structure entirely. In addition, doing a PhD on dance required another type of translation, from physical experiences to the written word. I often found myself typing with one hand, while the other was reaching out in the air, searching for words in the space around me, words that described the essence of the phenomena I was trying to convey.  I was used to dancing and using my body as a vehicle for expression, but now it spontaneously became a vehicle for embodied writing.
But finding my voice was also very much about finding confidence. Would I have something to contribute? Is what I would like to share meaningful enough? Would others find it in any way useful?
It was a great opportunity when I got a contract with an American publisher to re-write my thesis, and the editors really encouraged me to find my own voice. They suggested to let go of ‘the dissertationese’ and really investigate how my body and my dance practice shaped my academic writing. Although I haven’t completed this book yet, I have taken their encouragement in other pieces I have published since.
So a lot of what has helped me find my voice has been through my dance training and how I experience things for myself while I am teaching dance to others. I realise this learning is significant enough to help me make the bridge to include this in ‘the academic endeavour’, and even though I am still not sure about this embodied writing process and how it is seen as valid by others, I am convinced it’s worth trying. After all, my voice is part of my body.

Presenting my methodology and informing philosophical perspective was where I realised I needed to work on developing my voice in my PhD, especially in my adoption of a participatory action research approach. I found a framework about three broad pathways of first, second and third-person action research by Reason and Bradbury (2001) and it helped me to find a way to consider where my voice was amongst my co-participants (as I saw myself as a scribe writing on behalf of others) and how to work with the informing literature. The first pathway, focused on my attempt to foster an inquiring approach, to act with awareness and to carefully consider the effects of my actions. The second path addressed my ability to inquire with others regarding issues of mutual concern, with a focus on dialogue including critique of the literature (which was another challenge in itself, especially when trying to digest theories which I experienced as too densely articulated). The third pathway was a combination of the previous two, whilst offering the opportunity to open up the conversation wider, with others not directly involved, and therefore to think of what my study could contribute to theory, practice and research.
I also remember being told by my supervisors how important my discussion chapter was in presenting my voice, and to distinguish my ‘scholarly identity’ in making the transition from analysis into interpretation. I guess I came to realise my voice was about communicating my researcher stance, but as a position - which was/is not static - this took time to try and articulate, especially as I felt I was working at the boundaries of different philosophical paradigms. Thinking of the examiners also shaped my writing, as context is relevant, and I knew I would have opportunity to write about the study in other ways post-doc.
