**Tip 3: Get a safe space (November 2018)**

By 'safe space' I am not referring to a space where you are free from criticism. When I talk about a safe space, I am referring to somewhere that you can work efficiently, and focus:

It is important to get a safe space to work where you are able to focus and - hopefully - not be distracted or disturbed. Your safe space will reflect your own requirements. As such, no 2 safe spaces are likely to be exactly the same. For some, it will be a quiet place where others are less likely to disturb you (for example, in the library). Some people may want to be completely alone, so that distractions from chatting are simply not possible. For others, it may mean having music on with noise cancelling headphones on, such that you are in your own world working away on your writing or data analysis. The important take away here is that there is no single way that people must have their safe space - we are all different in that respect.

Just remember, it is important to give yourself the opportunity to maximise your work time - whether that be writing, analysis or whatever other work you have to do for the PhD - and that location is not set in stone. Whilst it is good for you to spend time in the offices or on campus, it is not compulsory to do so every day. In general, as long as your DoS/supervisory team know where you are, what you are doing, and how to contact you, you can work wherever is best for you.
