# What is the PGR newsletter?

The PGR newsletter is a monthly newsletter made by post-graduate researchers in the Health and Life Sciences at Coventry University. We have designed this to be a combination of brief, informative, and light-hearted information, so that you can understand all the goings on at the university relevant for post-grads at the start of every month.

Our mission is to make a publication that people will be able to spend a few minutes to glance over and get what they need, but with some more depth should they seek it. It is for post-grads, by post-grads.

We are always looking for suggestions, advice, or even an extra pairs of hands (should you want to help). Even if you feel that you do not have time to commit to regularly helping out, you could still contribute a one-off piece such as a short article or health and wellbeing advice. If you are interested in writing a piece for our newsletter, read our [submission guidelines](https://hls-pgr-newsletter.github.io/HLS-PGR-newsletter.github.io/contactus/) and email the [editor](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+editor@gmail.com).
