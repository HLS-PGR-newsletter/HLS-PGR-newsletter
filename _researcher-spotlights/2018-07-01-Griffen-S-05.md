subtitle: This month, PhD student Corbin Griffen is under our spotlight.

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Scott McGuire, a PhD student in clinical exercise physiology.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

Multidisciplinary research into the effects of age-related sarcopenia

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis to dummies**

My PhD thesis is investigating the effects of resistance exercise and increasing protein in the diet (through whey protein supplementation) on multiple markers of healthy ageing in retired men aged 60-80 years. My research uses a novel metabolic chamber based at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW) to assess markers of whole-body metabolism under highly-controlled conditions for 36 hours. There are only 2 of these facilities in the UK.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

I had previous experience prior to undertaking this PhD as a Research Associate at a couple of institutions working on human dietary intervention trials in middle/older aged adults and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I wanted the opportunity to be principle investigator on my own trial. In addition, the chance to undertake a PhD using such novel instruments such as the Human Metabolism Research Unit (HMRU) at UHCW was an opportunity I could not turn down.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

Read as much as you can and widely. Try get to a conference early so you know what other researchers in your field are researching.

**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

[Bad Science by Ben Goldacre](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/000728487X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529922897&sr=8-1&keywords=ben+goldacre+bad+science). It’s a brilliant book which criticises how mainstream media report on health issues. Two particular chapters I found interesting were Chapter 5 ‘The placebo effect’ in health research, and also Chapter 13 ‘Bad Stats’ which covers the case of two women, in which poor understanding and presentation of statistics played an important part in their criminal trials. These chapters highlight the importance of well-designed research studies. There is also a [website Goldacre has with more examples of bad science](https://www.badscience.net/).
