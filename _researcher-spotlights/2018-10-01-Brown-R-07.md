subtitle: This month, Clinical Physiotherapy PhD student, Russell Brown, is under our spotlight.
---

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Russell Brown, a PhD student in Neuro-Physiotherapy.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

A feasibility study of very brief interventions (VBIs) use for risk reducing behaviours in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) during primary care consultations.  

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis to dummies**

Adults with T2DM have a 2-3 times risk of CVD compared to the general population. Recent research indicates that the communication of the CVD risks delivered in primary care is ineffective at altering patient behaviour designed to reduce the incidence of stroke and heart attacks. My study will test a new very brief intervention (VBI), designed to improve the content and style of CVD education/advice delivered during primary care diabetic consultations; with the aim of increasing risk reducing behaviour, and hopefully reduce the incidence of stroke and heart attacks.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

Several years ago, when working as a physiotherapist involved in the rehabilitation of young adult stroke survivors (< 65yrs), I observed an common dominator amongst a section, of mostly male survivors, who had had a recent diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). This piqued my curiosity, especially as many of these patients where close to my age, to investigate what the literature would reveal about the link and risk between T2DM, Stoke and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) was in young adults. I embarked on a Master’s by Research (NIHR MRes Studentship) project to investigate the CVD risk and link of T2DM. My PhD is an extension of that initial enquiry; I am currently investigating the use of a new intervention to effectively communicate an individual’s cardiovascular risk to improve risk-reducing behaviours, with the aim to reduce the frequency of Stroke and Heart Attack in adults with T2DM.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

In my case it would a clear case of not following my own (or Winston Churchill’s) advice; “Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.” Nurture, but examine your supervisory team, to determine whether they have the skill set you require to not only successfully complete your research project, but have the expertise in your methodology, including presenting this design in a doctoral level thesis. Utilise your Development Needs Analysis and plan and plan again;

N.B. Fail to plan- is plan to fail (Benjamin Franklin, 1782).   

**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

I would not be so bold, but individually I found James Hayden’s PHD: An Uncommon guide (2015) very helpful. There are wealth of postgrad guides but I found this book did not try to over-simplify the PhD process to a series of pre-defined steps. It reflected the variety and complexity of research projects, not to mention the differences in resources and personal circumstances of PhD students, and recognises that no set process can ever adequately cover every situation.

No Clichés or tortured metaphors, instead, this book identifies fundamental principles which can be adapted and applied in different situations. It recognises the complexity of research and writing, and that the key to success is in responding effectively to unpredictable circumstances, rather than following a fixed plan or roadmap.


**What is something you do for fun when not focussing on your research degree?**

If only I had the spare time to indulge in previous hobbies. I do try and punish myself in the gym at least once a week, and cycle or run at the weekend. But ironically, this is when I do focus on my project, with a clear mind it allows time to plan. Plus, I have two lovely children under the age of five that keep me feeling young (constantly knackered) that occasionally I need to escape from to recharge my batteries.
