subtitle: This month, Sports Psychology PhD student, Mairi Mulvenna, is under our spotlight.

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Mairi Mulvenna, a PhD student in sports psychology.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

Motivation influences athlete well-being and sporting success.

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis to dummies**

My PhD thesis focuses on testing an integrated theoretical approach of achievement motivation and how this impacts athlete well-being and performance in sport. In addition to considering the goal an individual wishes to achieve, we are interested in gaining an enhanced understanding of the influence both the reasons and environment underpinning goal pursuit can have on optimal healthy functioning and performance..

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

After completing my MSc degree in Applied Sport Psychology at St Mary’s University, Twickenham and seeking a career in academia, I knew a doctorate degree was the next natural step and started to look for potential interesting projects I could apply for. I was emailed an opportunity being advertised at Coventry University by my MSc course director and supervisor and encouraged to submit an application. The topic had room for scope but was largely surrounding my research interests of motivation, anxiety and stress in sport which I had spent some time working on during my undergraduate and MSc research so I thought it looked great! A successful application and interview later, here I am!

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

Those first few months starting off on this new journey are certainly a daunting encounter that can leave you feeling overwhelmed and even a little scared, questioning “what have I let myself in for!?” The main thing to remember is not to panic, this is a learning experience; one that will entail many ups and downs but always think about why you started. You most likely have a passion for the topic and want to make a change, so feed that energy into reading (a lot!), getting to grips with a more in-depth insight into the research area and how it has evolved over time – this is so important and will essentially shape how your PhD progresses. Do not be afraid to ask for help or advice. Asking for help is not a weakness – after all your supervisory team are in that role for a reason, so make as much use of their expertise as much as possible. They were once in your position and, in time, you will be in theirs as you develop as an expert in your research field.

**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

Probably a different suggestion to what you are expecting, but I would advise post-graduates to read a book that is far removed from their research area. Whether that be a good novel, fiction or non-fiction, an autobiography, poetry, the list is endless – it is important to give your brain a rest from work!

**What is something you do for fun when not focussing on your research degree?**

I am a keen sportswoman myself and so when I am not working on my research, you can usually find me training for or competing in [Gaelic Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football), one of our national sports in Ireland. Gaelic Football is one of four sports controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in Ireland. Although it is predominantly played back home in Ireland, you can find clubs all over the world. I play for a local club here in Coventry, [Roger Casements](http://www.rogercasements.co.uk/category/blog/allposts/teamnews/ladiesteam/), as well as the [Coventry University](https://www.cusu.org/clubs/womensgaelicfootball/) and county teams. I am very lucky to have had some great successes to date and hope to look forward to many more. Otherwise, I enjoy socialising to catch up with friends and family, reading and travelling. It’s incredibly important to remember to take time out from your research and switch off, engaging with activities that you enjoy and that will help you relax. It is important to remember: Your PhD is part of your life, *not* your **whole** life!
