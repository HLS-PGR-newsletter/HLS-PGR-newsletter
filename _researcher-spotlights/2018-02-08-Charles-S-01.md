It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves. 

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. Speaking of which, the first post-grad under our spotlight is Sarah Charles, a first year PhD student in Psychology. 

## Sarah Charles

## **Thesis title**

Behavioural and neurochemical mechanisms of social bonding during religious rituals: The role of synchrony and endogenous opioids

## **In 50 words, explain your thesis for dummies**

What exactly makes people feel like they are close to each other? Do religious rituals do anything special to make this feeling happen more easily? People aren't sure about either question, so I'm going to try and find out.

## **Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

I have always been interested in emotions. How they work and change is fascinating. My MSc looked at the mechanisms music utilised to regulate emotions and now I wanted to look at a different type of emotion – social emotion - which lead me to looking into the causes of social bonding.

## **What advice would you give yourself in the first three months of your PhD?**

Expect to do a lot more reading and a lot less writing than you anticipated in your first few months. Don't panic. Stay calm, and get a small bit of work done each day. I promise you, it is entirely normal to feel disoriented and like you aren't accomplishing much early on. You aren't alone in that feeling, so don't beat yourself up over it. 

## **What book or article do you recommend that every PhD student should read?**

Phantoms in the Brain by V.S. Ramachandran. Not only is it a fascinating book that helped spark my desire to go into research science growing up, but Ramachandran also shows how even some of the most seemingly complicated research problems can have simple solutions to them, with a bit of creativity.
