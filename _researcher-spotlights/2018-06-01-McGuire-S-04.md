subtitle: This month clinical exercise physiology PhD student Scott McGuire is under our spotlight.
---

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Scott McGuire, a PhD student in clinical exercise physiology.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

Acute physiological responses to exercise in end stage renal disease.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

Originally, I planned on doing a PhD in my previous role as a nutritionist at Manchester United, but I didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of a PhD at a premiership club. My doubts mainly came from my thoughts around what little impact my research would have if I was to devote my efforts into player performance. I always wanted to do research which meant something and impacted as many people as possible. I always had an urge to work more in a clinical role, therefore, I began looking for clinical based PhDs in my line of expertise and came across Coventry University who were initially beginning to set up a clinical exercise research team. After applying and securing my place I quickly knew this was the right path for me and I have never looked back. My PhD has changed my life in such a big way so much so that I now want to pursue medicine on completion of my research.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

Slow down and focus on what needs to be done first. I initially struggled with this mainly because I felt that there was such a monumental task ahead of me, that I needed to get to work from the very start and take on lots of tasks at once. Although I would say that starting early helps in any academic endeavour, it is critical to prioritise tasks to ensure good quality work. You can’t rush the process, PhDs really are a marathon and not a sprint, and it requires lots of day to day effort to compile a thesis worth reading.

**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

A PhD is such a unique and bespoke journey for every student and therefore I feel there is no book/article that can really prepare you for your PhD. I would say that before starting that you really ask yourself as early as possible if the research topic is something you are interested in and are passionate about. Never undertake a research program because it seems like the right thing to do. It must be something you want to devote your life to for a number of years, and if the passion isn’t there it will quickly be exposed and make for a long three years. Also, your PhD topic is something you will be asked about throughout your career and if you have little passion or care for what you found then you will be revisiting a topic you dislike with your future colleagues on multiple occasions. You have to make sure it’s something you’re going to be proud of and want to talk about later down the line, it has to have been worth all the struggle and effort. Twenty-one months in, dare I say I still enjoy my PhD topic. I’m hopeful this won’t change.
