It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Jodie Enderby, a Master’s by Research student in Psychology.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**
The predictive roles of prosody, morphology and phonology for multisyllabic word reading and spelling in children.

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis for dummies?**
I am looking at what different language skills best help children to read and spell longer words. Specifically looking at which skills (Prosody, Phonology, Morphology) have the highest predictive values for these. Another interest would be how children decode these, and where they can go wrong when doing so.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**
I chose this topic because it links well with recent research into speech rhythm interventions, which can be used to help children learn to read. Many music related interventions have also been found to be very effective for helping children with dyslexia learn to read. This is a section of psychology that really interests me and relies on emerging research. Recent research suggests that these types of prosodic-based interventions may be effective, even when more popular phonology and morphology-based interventions may not be able to produce results. Only a small amount of research papers have looked at how this effect can relate to longer, harder words that become increasingly more important throughout development, but are ignored by all models of reading. This is despite words with multiple syllables accounting for an average of 90% of the English language. Early work shows significant results in heterogeneous groups of children and adults, even those with reading disorders or poor reading skills. Although little current work has observed all three meta-linguistic skills and their combined predictive values for this.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your post-graduate degree?**
If there is anything that you were worried about, there is probably a reason that you are worried about it, so make sure to explore your options early, and make sure to set it up in time. Whether it be meeting schedules, time management, data collection or ethics etc. It will put your mind at ease and try to avoid unnecessary stress and hopefully help you to have the things that you need at the deadlines they will be needed by.

**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**
I do not think that there is a one size fits all book, but a good step is to try exploring books that enable you to become better acquainted with the analysis that you are using. Hugh Coolican’s books on ‘Research methods and statistics and Psychology’, and ‘SPSS for Psychologists’ by Brace, Kemp and Snelgar have been found to work for the methods that I am using. It is also helpful to read any relevant past PhD’s from people in your field to get to grips with their logic, theory, and general PhD layouts, so I would highly recommend it.
