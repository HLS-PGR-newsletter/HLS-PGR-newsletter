subtitle: This month, Sports Science PhD student, Jorje Lopez, is under our spotlight.

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Jorje Lopez, a PhD student in sports science.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

An integrated intervention model to improve behavioural change involving an active lifestyle in inactive populations

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis to dummies**

As promoters of a healthy lifestyle, we think that fitness centres may play a key role in addressing physical activity. For that reason, my research wants to identify what these centres need to change to engage inactive people in regular exercise.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

It was given to me together with the overall project. It was not my first idea for a PhD, but I accept the challenge of developing it even though my expertise was not specific to this topic.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

I left behind a stable job - and my home country, Spain - to enrol for this research project at Coventry. So, from the very beginning, I felt some panic. Despite this panic, I decided to face this degree as a personal challenge.
If I could go back I would strongly recommend myself to focus on what really matters (which indeed it is not the research) and leave aside the self-imposed pressure.
Finishing the research degree is important for all of us and one of the hardest tasks we will ever face in our life (at least some of us). However, it is easier and faster to complete it if we surround ourselves with other students that share the same objective. Therefore, I would tell me "forget about your research, the difficulties you have, get new friends and enjoy your time in Coventry because what really matters, and what will really help you achieve your goal is to make sure that you enjoy the pathway - the journey - not get the expected outcomes". This advice would have helped me early on to allow me to make friends that would keep my focus high when I am working, and give me the ability to relax when I am not working.


**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

I think that many of us are so tired of reading new things for our research that we do not fancy reading anything else at the end of the day. Or, we may feel guilty reading something else when we could be reading something research focused. However, for me, reading any adventures book keep me fresh for the next day. Thus, I think all of us should find the kind of book that transports us to a different place and enjoy it. That way, you can recharge and get back to being focused on finishing your research degree.

**What is something you do for fun when not focussing on your research degree?**

I like to go out with my friends and wander around the city. I also like to go to the theatre, read some fiction novels or do some sports. However what moves me is to have the chance to travel abroad and see new places and cultures. So I am always thinking of my next destination
