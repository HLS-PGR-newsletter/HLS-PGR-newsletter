subtitle: This month, forensic psychology PhD student, Jorge Lopez, is under our spotlight.
---

It is the nature of post-graduate work that people are dotted around in different locations. They may be in different offices, different buildings, or even off-site. We at the Newsletter feel it is important for post-grads to get to know each other, especially as we all have vastly different topics. As a result, we have designed this section as a short introduction to read a little about researchers who have chosen to answer a few questions about themselves.

We will be placing the spotlight on a new researcher every month, so you can get to know their topic a little better and hear some of their advice and recommendations. If you want to be under the spotlight, address your [email](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+spotlight@gmail.com) to either James Bartlett or Sarah Charles. The latest post-grad under our spotlight is Sahar Shahid, a forensic psychology PhD student.

**What is your thesis title (or working title)?**

Factors that increase or mitigate risk of engagement in criminal behaviour in children who have experienced child maltreatment.

**In 50 words, how would you explain your thesis to dummies**

Many children experience abuse in childhood. A high proportion of offenders have histories of childhood maltreatment. My research aims to explore why some individuals who have been abused in childhood become violent in later life, whilst others do not. I explore the link between symptoms of trauma and violent behaviour.

**Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

I worked with victims of violence for some years before returning to education to do a master’s degree in Forensic Psychology before pursuing my PhD. I have a passion for violence reduction in society and to help reduce the emotional suffering that comes as a result of violence. This can be achieved in various ways. One can either support victims once the violence has happened or target the root cause for some types of violence, in some instances – trauma in childhood. Through my research I want to identify how we can enhance treatment and interventions for violent offenders who have been traumatised in childhood as well as how we can implement support and interventions for children who have been abused so that their inclination towards violence, due to trauma can be reduced. My PhD topic allows me to explore and develop my understanding of these topics as well as to hopefully contribute to both the academic field and practice in some way.

**Looking back, what advice would you give to yourself in the first three months of your research degree?**

I think everyone feels quite lost at the beginning of a PhD (even if you know exactly what you want to do in your project) not knowing that everyone is feeling the same way. It’s important to understand that feeling lost is okay. I would suggest engaging with the PGR community and getting involved as much as you can in things that interest you. It will help you to understand how vastly different but also similar people’s experiences and feelings around doing a research degree can be. Another piece of advice would be to manage ambitions regarding your project. You will not save the world through this one project. I still have to remind myself of this! (And where I forget many others will do it for me). I would also say – enjoy the uncertainty, because it means there is a lot of scope for exploration of your topic area and research methods.


**What book or article do you think every post-graduate should read?**

I’m not sure I can suggest one for all PGRs, but I think it’s so important to read literature you enjoy that is not to do with your PhD. I love crime thrillers – okay maybe not entirely unrelated, but it’s something I read because I want to, not because I have to. I do think it’s important to find humour somewhere though, I find ‘PhD Comics’ on social media are quite funny and relatable.

**What is something you do for fun when not focussing on your research degree?**

I read fiction and write poetry. I also see friends, especially when I feel I need a break from the PhD. It is essential to take time away from the research – both work wise and from thinking about it, otherwise it will feel like it takes over your life. Not taking time for yourself, speaking from experience, is not healthy nor is it sustainable.
