title: Spending the Holiday Season in Coventry
subtitle: The PGR Newsletter team talks about what you can do if you can't go back home over the Xmas period.

# Background

As we in the research community know, there are many PGRs here at Coventry University who are here from all over the world. Be you from another city in the UK or from another continent, there may be some reason that you cannot go back home and see family over the holiday season. This includes some of us at the PGR Newsletter.

# PGR Meet-Ups Over the Holidays
We know that this period of time is one where work inevitably slows down due to others going on leave and the university closing between Christmas day and New Year’s Day. With the level of work over this time slowing down, people are likely to want to spend time with others. As a result, the PGR Newsletter are helping to organise ways in which PGRs at Coventry can do so to help keep spirits high over the holidays.

If you would like to hang out with other PG students over the holidays, please get in contact with the PGR Newsletter team at [cov.pgrnewsletter+hnw@gmail.com](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+hnw@gmail.com) and we’ll put you in touch with other PG students to meet up with.
Please note: By providing your contact details you are consenting to them being shared with other students who respond to this call  


 # Christmas Markets:

As well as helping organise meet-ups with other PGRs, we thought it would be a good idea to provide you with some information about some events that take place over the holiday period in and around Coventry. It's that time of year again and Christmas Markets are opening across the world! Coventry has 4 great Christmas markets within easy travel distance so get a group together and enjoy the festivities of the season.
