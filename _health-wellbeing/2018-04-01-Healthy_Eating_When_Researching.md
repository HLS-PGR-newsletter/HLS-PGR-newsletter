When working hard on a PhD, balanced meals can completely go out the window. With time an essence it is so important to make sure you are eating the right balance of foods to keep your brain active and concentration levels high. Even though this is known, with deadlines looming, snacking is a common occurrence, just to keep hunger at bay while that literature review is being done - probably at 2am!
Choosing the right food during deadlines or exam periods will help you, not only keep any excess weight at bay, but help to sleep better and stop reaching for the high-sugar high-fat and normally over-priced foods from the convenience store next door! The key ingredient for all of this is preparation is key, pre-cut carrot sticks snack-pot may cost you £1 a pot from a local store but may cost you about 10p if you were to make them yourselves. After all, we are still students, so saving money in these places can also help reduce stress!

The best food groups to be keeping high in your diet are:
-            *Vegetables*
-            *Fruits*
-            *Proteins*
-            *Fibre*

*Carbohydrates* are always an important food group, but if you are sitting at a desk with not much activity, carbs are not as essential for the energy expenditure.

With some research on the best food groups, we have listed a few below:

* Fresh veggie sticks

Chop up carrots, celery, cucumber, peppers, or any other raw vegetable you fancy.
These sorts of snacks are easy to carry around (you can even just stick them in a Tupperware) and the process of biting them works as stress relief in itself.

* Handful of nuts
Nuts are full of good fats and magnesium, which helps keep cortisol (stress) levels low. Like the veggie sticks above, the physical distraction of munching on nuts one by one can work as an edible stress ball whilst giving you loads of useful energy. Opt for the low-sodium or unsalted kinds, as one ounce of salted roasted almonds contains 100 times more sodium than the unsalted varieties. An added bonus is that walnuts are particularly good for improving your memory, in the long term, as they're full of omega 3 and polyphenols (also good for stress).

**NB:** do not eat too many nuts as they are yummy and very moreish, but still high in calories.

* Cooked Chickpeas
If you are a hummus or falafel lover, these make a great lunch and high in protein. However, for snacking purposes, cooked and cooled chickpeas are a tasty snack and high in protein, keeping you fuller for longer! A sprinkle of seasoning or cracked sea salt if you feel they taste bit plain, but these are some of our favourites!

* Popcorn
People love a good movie or TV show to relax to after a long day in the office or lab. This usually brings with it the desire to snack whilst watching. A great alternative to crisps is the cinema staple, popcorn. Also, research has shown if you eat with your non-dominant hand you’re likely to eat less and less likely to start ‘mindless eating’ - or keep the bowl out of hand reach so you have to reach for them. Try and go for the air-dry home-popped popcorn if you fancy splashing out on a popcorn maker as you can control the butter / sugar going in to them.

* Fruit Salad
Mix together your favourite seasonal fruits. Put them in a large bowl and refrigerate for a couple hours in order for the natural, sugary juices to mingle and marinate. This way, you can satisfy your sweet tooth without inhaling sweets.

* Frozen Grapes
If the fruit salad is not working for you, try buying grapes and freezing them overnight. You’ll wake up with one of the most refreshing alternatives to sugary boiled sweets.

* Cereal
High fibre cereal, like shredded wheats, wheat biscuits (or minis), fruit and fibre etc. are all great choices to snack on – I advise to have them dry, as this means the 30g recommended daily allowance can go a long way when snacking!
