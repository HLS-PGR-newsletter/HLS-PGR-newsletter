We all know the importance of eating a healthy balanced diet. Alongside the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and all-cause mortality, the benefits to your concentration, retention and mental health are well documented. All these very important in life, and the last 3 specifically during your studies!

However, between the piling work load, staying physically active, maintaining social relationships, acquiring some important ‘you’ time, and getting your regular hours of sleep each night, eating healthily can sometimes take the back bench. It is also easy to fall into the trap of a diet of only pasta, or noodles when prices seem dirt cheap compared to fresh produce, and cooking times are as long as it takes to boil the kettle.

But there is good news. Students can eat healthy food for less! Read on for some tips on how to eat healthy without breaking the bank on your weekly food shop.

## Know your area.

*	Skip the trip to the convenience store where you might pay more for less healthy options, and opt for your local market or supermarket.

*	Coventry city centre hold a [farmer’s market]( https://www.coventry.gov.uk/events/event/5171/farmers_market_in_broadgate) every 3rd Friday of the month 9am-3pm at Broadgate (just outside Primark)

*	Coventry Market is also a great place to get high quality, affordable produce and

*	Both [Lidl]( https://www.lidl.co.uk/en/Store-Finder-4186.htm) and [Aldi](https://www.aldi.co.uk/store-finder/?q=CV15NR&address=Canterbury+St%2C+Coventry+CV1+5NR&latitude=52.41157800000001&longitude=-1.4995070999999598) are only a half hour walk from the Hub.

## Write a shopping list and stick to it!

*	When you’re in a shop you might find something that catches your fancy and think “oh…maybe I should add this as well”. Whilst doing so one-off isn’t too much of a problem, doing so multiple times can add up, especially across repeated grocery shopping trips over the year(s).

*	Also, try shopping after eating instead of before. You’ll be surprised to see how much less you spend on [high-fat and sugary snacks simply because you’re hungry](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1685889?referringRepId=208230).

## Alternatives can work, too

*	If you find that fresh produce is costing you more or turns (aka goes off) too quickly, try looking for frozen alternatives. Frozen food is just as good for you if you avoid those with added sugar, fat or salt, and can often cost less while lasting substantially longer. For example, [Lidl’s 1kg bag of frozen veg]( https://www.lidl.co.uk/en/Products.htm?articleId=1254) is only 79p! and a [similar bag from Tesco is £1.10]( https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/264226012?sc_cmp=ppc*GHS+-+Grocery+-+New*PX+%7C+Shopping+GSC+%7C+All+Products+%2B+Tesco+Brand*PRODUCT+GROUP264226012*&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpcLZBRCnARIsAMPBgF2K17SftvTONwin0qPbjaM1zbF8HgZhsZmubP2WiCcyh1RCgD0IuWwaAm0TEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CMXFxP2O79sCFTIy0wodYxIKcA) (prices given are those found at the time of writing).

*	Don’t be afraid to try new things. Keeping a varied diet is not only good for you, but can keep your meals interesting. Try the cheaper brands, the difference in taste is often minimal but the savings add up, just make sure to check the traffic light labels for recommended daily intake guides (Green, Amber and Red in the ring listing sugar, fat, salt etc.).

*	Eat more vegetables. If you aren’t a vegetarian or vegan, it is likely that meat, poultry or fish are a part of at least one of your meals every day. With meat and fish typically being some of the most expensive foods on your weekly food shop, trying an alternative vegetarian recipe once or twice per week for some of your favourite dishes can not only save you money, but also increase your vegetable intake. Add in some pulses such as beans, lentils or peas instead of meat to keep the calories and fat down but your fibre intake up.

*	Swap out your luxuries for cheaper, healthier alternatives. Fizzy drinks are high in sugar and bad for your waist-line, but if you can’t get by without your ‘fizz-fix’ try reaching for the sparkling water instead.

*	For those days when the cravings for take away just won’t subside, try making your own “fake-away”. With a quick google you can access recipes for home-made Chinese, Indian and pizza recipes. Look for recipes that swap out heavy oils and fats for healthier ingredients, or try experimenting yourself. Not only can this reduce the calorie intake by hundreds, it can also save you £££’s. (Note: for cost-effectiveness of the fake-away, unlike most dishes pre-made curry paste is usually cheaper than buying the individual ingredients to make the paste from scratch unless you’re making VERY large quantities… and they are often still heathy)

## Cooking habits

*	Cooking can also be a great opportunity for socialising and bonding with your flat/house-mates. Schedule some time each week to get together and swap recipes from home. Splitting the cost for the ingredients between you will help keep the meals cheap.

*	Don’t always have time or the energy for a home-made meal from scratch? Try making a little extra when you cook and freeze it for a quick re-heatable meal. Just be sure you follow the [food hygiene and safety guidelines](https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/chilling) when you save and re-heat the leftovers.

## Some extra tips

*	Shop during ‘Happy Hour’. Most supermarkets offer discounts to their fresh produce at the end of the day. Change up your weekly shop hour to find when your local offers the best deals.

*	But don’t deny yourself treats. The key to successful change is to make small changes, gradually overtime. Chocolate and snacks can make up part of a varied, balanced diet, but remember, moderation is key. To maintain a healthy diet, keep a healthy relationship with food and your body.

* If you want to find out more, try looking online for trusted websites like the [NHS Choices](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/) and [Cook and Eat Well](https://cookandeatwell.co.uk/), or take a look at any number of 100s of healthy recipes provided on the [BBC website](https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes).
