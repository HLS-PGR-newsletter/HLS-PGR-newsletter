title: Dealing With Stress During A Research Degree
subtitle: Some advice from Rachael Barker.

During a research degree, at some point one will go through a stressful point in their research, whether it be before the PRP, an ethics application that doesn’t go to plan, or of course the VIVA that we’ve all grown to fear!

So how do we deal with stress? Well, as we know, stress can be - in some parts - a good thing. People can be driven by stress and need that ‘Kick’ of a deadline to get them moving again. (I know I do!) However, too much stress can cause negative consequences, lead to adverse reactions such as demotivation, depression and ultimately ceasing ones research altogether.

So, with this first article I’ve decided to talk about some of the ways we can deal with stress during your research journey. Stress can be seen in many ways, such as; constantly feeling you can’t work hard enough, feeling overwhelmed by the workload, feeling that you have no control over your project, and feeling like you don’t belong in a PhD program and that you will be “found out” (also known as imposter syndrome).

When you start to feel like this, one thing to do would be to stop, take a break, and if needs be - write a list of all the things you have achieved so far in your MRes/PhD. That way you can see the positives and not be clouded by the negatives that may cloud your “I can totally do this” attitude. One way to do this can be during your log of thoughts to write all the achievements made that week. These small victories can add up!

One thing we all must remember, is ‘a PhD/MRes is hard, and that’s okay’, it’s not impossible. You are in this because you are good enough to be, and self-belief is half the battle.

One of things I have heard about dealing with stressful situations is through the idea of mindfulness, and taking a moment away to recoup your thoughts. Take time to yourself, you will thank yourself later!

Tips to stay positive in a PhD:
1.	Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Your supervisory team, and research friends are there to help and support, they may need help and support themselves one day.
2.	Take care of yourself, PhD’s are renowned for long hours and no sleep. Do one thing each day for yourself and have time to do something away from your PhD.
3.	Network with other students, the worse thing is feeling alone and thinking you are the only one going through it. A PhD/MRes social, as well as making friends will ultimately show you that everyone is going through the same thing.
4.	Celebrate the smallest of conquests! A PhD is one long journey, instead of looking at that 3-year timeline, celebrate each abstract that gets accepted, even each 1000 words you’ve written on your thesis, you’re one step closer to have a full written draft, go you!
5.	Challenge any negative thoughts by noting down all the positives, have a positive thinking board, motivational quotes, anything that will help in those times of need.
6.	Try new things, don’t be afraid to step outside the box and remember, the PhD/MRes is not forever - there is a bright, bright beautiful world after your viva and graduation, whether it be in research or anything, it’s your life, go live it!
