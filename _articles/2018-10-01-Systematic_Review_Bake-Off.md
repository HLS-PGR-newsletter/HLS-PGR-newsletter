For the technical challenge today, Paul and Prue would like you to … conduct a systematic review.

A systematic review is type of literature review summarising and critically analysing the results of available studies. Compared to a literature review, a systematic review follows a standard set of (systematic) stages to gather all the relevant literature for the research question.

Also, Great British Bake Off has been great so far this year. So, here are some top tips for conducting a systematic review, Bake Off style.


## 1. The flavours

As the bakers embark on their signature bake they have thought carefully about their flavours and how the tastes combine to melt in the mouth. Before conducting a systematic review, you need to have done your research, know what flavours go together and what has already been done well (and no so well). What research there is in your field and would a systematic review be useful. Has a systematic review already been conducted? If there has, does it warrant an update? Are you reviewing the effectiveness of interventions and therefore do you need to follow the [PICO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0029906/) structure for extracting data from the papers you include? You also need to decide on your research question, depending on what literature is out there, your question may be very specific, or it could be very broad. Having a good research question and objective will help with the development of your protocol, search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria. It’s just about getting all the ingredients together and following a *recipe*.

## 2. The recipe

The best showstoppers come from a carefully set out, planned and designed recipe. A systematic review is very similar, you need a good recipe. In this case, a good protocol to follow, which has been well thought through, has the best quality ingredients, and includes a motivated and hardworking baker (reviewer)! You need to know what you’re doing before you start your review. Developing a protocol will get you to think about why you are doing a systematic review, where you are going to search, what you might include or exclude, what data you will extract, and how you will analyse and report the results. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols ([PRISMA-P](http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Checklist)) 2015 checklist is *really* helpful to make sure you have considered and thought about all the different parts of the systematic review before you start.
You can also register the review on PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Other bakers can see what your showstopper looks like, but they may want to see how the cake comes out first before trying it themselves. Registering your review avoids the duplication of reviews and improves transparency and rigor of reviews. You could also think about publishing your systematic review protocol in a journal.
It is easy to spend more time planning it, buying the ingredients, reading the recipe, carefully gathering all the equipment than actually doing it. Once you have a good protocol, make a start by conducting a scoping search, or bake a smaller scale practice of your show stopper; try some of the search terms, screen some papers and see how the inclusion and exclusion criteria fit - do you need to make some adjustments to the recipe? It is good when writing your protocol to have a few articles to practice on and you may just end up throwing the first bake the bin and starting from scratch. BUT, no one likes wasted cake! So, use your time wisely.

## 3. Prove

Don’t forget to prove, or make sure you give yourself the time to conduct the review. However, unlike baking, you can’t just put the dough in a proving drawer and then the oven to bake itself - unfortunately. A good systematic review takes time. Sometimes what felt like a simple recipe that’s 30 mins to prepare and 30 minutes to cook can actually take a whole day with all the hidden preparation and cleaning up time.
Also, for Laura conducting her **qualitative** review it has been really useful to give some time to just let it sit. Coming back to the analysis with fresh eyes means, not only does it feel like there was twice as much to do than when she left it, but a break gives a new perspective, or it seems to make much more sense.

## 4. And Bake

Now it’s time to write up the results of your review! Go back to your recipe (your protocol) – have you baked what you’ve said you would? If you altered the ingredients, have you had good, justifiable reasons why and been transparent about this? Baking, or writing your review, can also take time. If you’ve carried out an exploratory review, tell the reader what you have explored and what you have found. Decide what you want to include in tables and what you need to include in your main text, being wary of not repeating yourself, but also being aware that your narrative needs to include enough so that the reader knows what you are going on about! If you have conducted a review of interventions, what are your main findings – can you make any strong statements about what is the most effective intervention for the problem at hand?
For this part of the process, you’re going to have to open the oven and check your showstopper every now and then – sense check with your supervisors or co-authors that the framing of your argument makes sense from the information you have reviewed.
Don’t forget, it’s ok to highlight what you would do differently if you were to bake this again. If you don’t pre-empt your limitations and work out how you could overcome them in the future, Paul and Prue (your peer reviewers) certainly will anyway!

## 5. Taste test

It might look amazing on the outside, be decorated to perfection and have every layer of sponge being exactly the same width, but in Bake Off it’s also all about the taste (and getting a handshake from Paul). Your systematic review needs to read well while highlighting the most important results. What is the impact of your review, the ‘so what’ question? Who will this review help and why have you bothered baking it? It is also important to get your research out there and disseminate your findings to a wider audience. It’s a blooming good bake after all!
Piece of cake!
