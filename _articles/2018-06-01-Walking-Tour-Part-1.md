Doing a PhD can feel rather isolating at times, and overwhelming at others. One of the best ways to help keep your spirits from being low is to get to know your surrounding area. In 2017, Coventry won the accolade of “*2021 City of Culture*”. As a result it is more than worth go for a wonder round this new city you have found yourself in.


## Historic Buildings and Coventry’s History

### Cathedrals

As a result, it is a city undergoing a lot of redevelopment, but the old historic parts are being preserved.
The most famous of these historic buildings must be the Cathedrals. There have been 3 Cathedrals in Coventry over the last Millennium. The original Coventry Cathedral (Priory Church of St Mary) was built in the 12th Century under supervision of the Earl of Mercia. This Cathedral was around for close to 400 years before the dissolution of the monasteries saw to its decline in 1539. The remains of the original Cathedral can be seen at [The Priory Centre](https://www.coventrypriory.co.uk/). In fact. On **Saturday 2nd June 2018** they are running an educational workshop.
Around the corner to these remains we can see the more recent Cathedrals. The 2nd Cathedral, built in the 15th Century, was destroyed during a bombing run by the German Luftwaffe in November 1940. Having only gained Cathedral status in 1918, this did not deter the people of Coventry, who set the ball in motion for rebuilding the Cathedral the very next day. These ruins can be seen from **The Student Union**, and the **Herbert Art Gallery & Museum**.
Finally, we have the current Cathedral, opened in 1962, The Cathedral is open to visitors from 10am to 5pm Monday to Saturday and 12 noon to 4pm on a Sunday. It is a beautiful building designed by Sir Basil Spence. What’s even better, is that Students at Coventry University get to go for **free** (a word I’m sure most students love to hear). All you need to do is bring your Student Card. The Cathedral also offers the opportunity to go to the **Blitz Museum** for only £2. Though, do check if they are running other events, as this often means this Blitz experience is pre-booked.

### Churches

As well as these Cathedrals, those of you who like more religious architecture will be happy know that Coventry still has some of the oldest, still operating Churches in the Midlands. **Holy Trinity Church** was built in the 1200s and was restored in the 1800s. They hold open services for students, right on the edge of the main University Campus.

**The Church of St John the Baptist** in the city centre was built in 1343, and restored in the 1800s. Their stained-glass windows and awe-inspiringly beautiful building are something that any person with an interest in religious or cultural history should not miss out on.

### Museums

*	The Herbert Art Gallery & Museum

As mentioned above, the **Herbert Art Gallery and Museum** *(HAGM)* next to the CUSU Hub building is open from 10am to 4pm Monday-Saturday and from 12noon to 4pm in Sundays. They have a fantastic collection of art, historic pieces, archaeological finds and natural history exhibits.  As well as these collections, they run events for people to see a wider variety of art and also occasionally host a “Museum Late”, which includes Street Food and DJs among other “After Hours” events. They will be hosting a [One Night Stand]( http://www.theherbert.org/whats_on/1288/a_one_night_stand_with_tricity_vogue) as part of Gay Pride week on the 8th June.

*	The Coventry Transport Museum

Coventry was once a well-known production hub for the British transport/motor industry. Initially the *HAGM* started exhibiting some of the old cars that were staples of the British car industry before they realised the collection was getting too large. So, in 1980, they moved to their present site in the North of the City, about 10-minute walk from the main campus. The museum was revamped in 2015, so it is now one of the most modern museums in the Midlands.
Admission to the museum is **FREE**

A more recent treasure in Coventry is the completely volunteer-based music museum. This museum, which opened in just 2013, seeks to collect music made in Coventry, Nuneaton, Rugby, Leamington Spa and even nearer Birmingham. They specialise in hosting 2-tone music (the precursor of ska-punk), but also host a variety of other music.
Among their attractions, they have a 2-tone village with a Caribbean restaurant, a music studio that is free to use and. Being an independent museum and ran by volunteers, there is a nominal charge of £3.00 for Adults and £1.00 for Children between the ages of 5 and 15. This is a very small price to pay to start indulging in one of Coventry’s recent arrivals that contributed to the winning of the 2021 City of Culture award.
