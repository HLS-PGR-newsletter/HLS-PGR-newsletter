### Some background

At 24 years old, ten years after I had started experiencing symptoms, I was diagnosed with endometriosis. During the first year of my Ph.D. my symptoms were at their worst – I was in severe chronic pain every day. My  research is focused on improving the quality of life of women living with endometriosis. My work is my life and my life is my work. Even so, it’s really important that I put effort into maintaining balance in my life - So that I don’t become overwhelmed by work and so that I maintain my health. During my first year I had a laparoscopy to have my endometriosis lesions excised.  I found the recovery a lot tougher than I anticipated. I was stuck at home for weeks, I went through opiate withdrawal and I felt isolated from my supervisory team and fellow students. I have been practicing mindfulness and meditation for almost six years and last year I completed my training to be a mindfulness teacher. When I started practicing mindfulness, the concept that really made a difference to me was self-compassion. It did not come naturally to me. I had a very critical, negative mindset towards my life and my body – I felt I was very much at war with my body. I learned how to pace myself, how to self-manage, how to rest when I was fatigued and how to avoid going through the boom and bust cycle that so many people with chronic pain or illness get caught up in.

At the foundation of mindfulness practice is meditation. Meditation is the practice of sitting still and focusing on your experience in the current moment – usually by focusing on your breathing. It’s a common misconception that to meditate you need to ‘clear your mind completely’ – In reality, this isn’t possible. Instead, meditation is actually about observing any thoughts or emotions that come up and then bringing your attention back to the physical sensation of your breathing. Mindfulness can also be less structured than just meditation; even daily activities themselves can be made mindful. Being mindful just means that one should allow themselves to be in the moment. It all begins with nurturing self-compassion. People who are self-compassionate realise when they are suffering and respond to themselves with warmth, understanding, and by seeking connections with others (Neff, 2009). Mindfulness can help people combat the tendency to harshly judge or criticize themselves, which lowers their risk for anxiety and depression (Costa and Pinto-Gouveia, 2013).

Here are five ways that I use mindfulness to manage my symptoms whilst doing my Ph.D. that I hope can help others researching with a long-term illness:

### 5 tips

* Find ways of bringing mindful moments in to your day.  

I enjoy meditating in silence at home, but I always make sure I have a variety of meditations saved on my iPhone, this helps me to keep a regular practice. When I feel like I have been working too much I often plug in my headphones and listen to a guided meditation. Mark Williams and John Teasdale are two of my favourite mindfulness teachers. I also use the Pomodoro technique when I’m writing or screening articles for my systematic review.  I find this very similar to pacing. Vidymala Burch, a founder of Breathworks, who also lives with chronic pain wrote both of her books using a similar technique. If meditation isn’t your thing, don’t fret. I often use the longer breaks to go for a walk. Find an activity that helps you bring mindful moments to your day.

* Take time to notice the pleasant.

Our brains automatically watch for threats and danger; this is known as the negativity bias (Rozin and Royzman, 2001). Although humans were able to survive by staying alert in case of threat, this tendency also means that negative experiences have more of an impact on us than positive experiences. Since we automatically notice the negative, it can be a challenge to pay attention to and absorb the positive. One technique is to keep a gratitude diary. To do this, each evening write down ten positive things you observed or experienced during the day. Some examples include: nature, a nice cup of coffee, a good conversation, even a funny YouTube video. I also take photos of things I find pleasant. Looking through these when I’m struggling with pain, fatigue or tight deadlines helps me to stay balanced.

* Make daily activities mindful.

Instead of introducing new activities into your life, it can be easier to make regular daily activities more mindful. Simply absorbing one thing at a time is a great way to be actively, and easily, mindful. Focus on sensations when you have a shower or brush your teeth – really engage your senses. I used to find driving really stressful, but now I use it as a way to incorporate mindfulness into my day. I make an effort to be present whilst driving and avoid being in autopilot mode. It doesn’t matter which activity you choose, as long as you allow yourself to remain present and aware of your sensations as you take part in it.

* Slow down, pay attention, and be present.

When I notice the signs of tension or frustration I try to slow down and pay attention to what I’m doing. This helps stop me from ‘time travelling’ - when my thoughts spiral into ‘what if’ territory - this stops the self-critical thoughts of: ‘what if my pain comes back?’, ‘what if I’m not good enough to complete a Ph.D.?’ Notice and acknowledge achievements – no matter how small. Doing so helps build your resilience to negative thought processes. Some students use their ‘log of thoughts’ that they need to keep for their PRP as a way to log these small victories, too. This makes the mandatory paperwork less of a chore and more of a therapeutic endeavour.

* And again: be kind to yourself.

When I’m really busy or I’m struggling with pain or fatigue, I try to treat myself in the same way I would if my best friend was having these experiences.  This helps me to keep my thoughts in a positive place. I recognise the things I have achieved, I reassure myself that how I’m feeling will pass. I remind myself that resting and reflecting are just as important as data collection, writing chapters and working towards publication. If there are days where leaving the house won’t be possible, I make myself comfortable and alternate tasks so that I do something I enjoy as well as complete the tougher pieces of work. For example, I read fiction before I fall asleep and I schedule time for friends.

### Conclusion
Being organised, planning ahead and clear communication with supervisors are key to doing a PhD with a chronic illness, but taking care of yourself and noticing the pleasant will make your everyday activities so much easier.
