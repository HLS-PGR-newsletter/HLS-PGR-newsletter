### What are Open Science practices?

Open Science practices are a series of actions that you can perform across the whole research workflow to make the publication process more transparent. These include:

- Pre-registering the methodology of your study before you collect data. You could even submit your study as a [Registered Report](https://cos.io/rr/) which is even possible as a [graduate student](http://blog.efpsa.org/2016/09/09/publishing-a-registered-report-as-a-postgraduate-researcher/).

- Sharing your materials to make it easier for others to replicate your study.

- Sharing your data and analysis scripts to make it easier for others to reproduce the findings of your study.

- Sharing your manuscripts as a [pre-print](http://blog.psyarxiv.com/about-psyarxiv/) or publish your article [open access](http://libguides.coventry.ac.uk/rsp/openaccess) to enable unrestricted access to your research.

Research methods, particularly in psychology, are undergoing a revolution. It took the publication of an article purporting to provide evidence that people could see into the future for people to stop and think about their research practices ([Bem 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21280961)). This period culminated in a ground-breaking article suggesting many effects may not be replicable ([Open Science Collaboration 2015](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716)). This period of self-reflection has been given many names from the replication crisis to the statistical crisis, but perhaps we can now consider ourselves in a renaissance period ([Nelson et al. 2018](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011836)). Rather than continuing to talk about crises, perhaps it is now the time to talk about all the great things that are happening to develop Open Science practices, but one of the problems can be knowing where to start.

As postgraduates, we have a relatively short period of time where we are expected to become experts in our field. It may be unrealistic to expect us to also be at the forefront of developments in research methods. That is why we have developed an Open Science support group called CUDOS (Coventry University Developing Open Science). We started as a group of PhD students from the [Brain Belief and Behaviour lab](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/advances-in-behavioural-science/brain-belief-and-behaviour-research/) concerned about current research practices in psychology and we were inspired by a similar initiative at the [University of Lancaster](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/research/open-science/). The aim of this group is to learn from each other's experience of Open Science practices. We believe that one of the barriers to adopting these practices is a lack of time or knowledge in how they can be incorporated into your own research pipeline. This may be particularly important if they are also alien to your supervisors. For example, [my first attempt](https://bartlettje.github.io/BartlettJE.github.io/2017-03-29-effective-preregistration/) at pre-registration did not go particularly well, but I did not know any better at the time. It would have been great to be able to talk to somebody about it and receive some informal feedback. Nobody wants to make mistakes, especially postgraduates when we have this critical period before we are hunting for a job.  

The aim of our group is to share our knowledge of Open Science practices in an informal setting over a coffee or beer. In the near future we are also going to deliver some practical workshops. In the meantime, try and focus on how you could make one or two changes rather than trying to revolutionalise your whole workflow. For example, you could pre-register your hypotheses and methodology before you collect any data on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). I wrote about how you can do this in [my article](https://bartlettje.github.io/BartlettJE.github.io/2017-03-29-effective-preregistration/), but another excellent source can be found on [Cogtales](https://cogtales.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/preregistration-its-actually-a-really-good-idea/). Early career researchers are at the forefront of [promoting Open Science practices](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688730/) and we will be the ones who establish new research method norms as the older practices die out.

For more information, you can join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/165435830724121/) where we frequently share articles and blog posts. Alternatively, you can email CUDOS ([cuopenscience@gmail.com](mailto:cuopenscience@gmail.com)) or me (bartle16@uni.coventry.ac.uk) directly and we will happily answer any questions.

*[James Bartlett](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/researchers/james-bartlett/) is a third year psychology PhD student in the [Brain, Belief, and Behaviour Lab](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/advances-in-behavioural-science/brain-belief-and-behaviour-research/). His research focuses on the neurocognitive mechanisms associated with nicotine dependence and shouts a lot about research methods and statistics in psychology.*
