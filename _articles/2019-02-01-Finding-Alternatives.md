# Background
As many PGRs at CU are acutely aware, funding from the university itself is in short supply. As a young university, this is understandable – it is so young, in fact, that the first external assessment of its research I could find is [from 2008](https://www.rae.ac.uk/results/)!
In the 10-15 years CU has been doing research, it has taken on many research students across many disciplines in multiple faculties. Due to only being in the ‘biz’ for a short while, the large and deep pockets that older research universities such as The University of Oxford have from old property and connections, or UCL have from alumni donations aren’t present for students who need research funds at CU.

What CU lacks in past connections it tries to make up for in creating new opportunities with the relatively little money it does currently have. As part of this, the doctoral college put on a training workshop for PGRs in January called “Funding and Grant Applications for PGRs – Finding the Alternatives”. This workshop was given by [postgraduate-funding.com](https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/). Specifically, by given by [Luke Blaxill](https://www.lukeblaxill.com/), the website’s founder – who has won over 40 grants in order to pay for his PhD, and who has since taught at the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge and King’s College, London.

This piece will cover some of the insights that Luke gave us during the workshop and will be split into 5 sections:

1.	Outlining what the website offers, and how to use your CU credentials to get free access to use the website.
2.	An introduction to what types of alternative funding exist.
3.	How to find funders that are appropriate for you (not just on the website, but elsewhere)
4.	How to approach these funders to increase the likelihood of getting a successful grant
5.	How to actually apply.



## Using the Website

As a CU student, your university credentials can be used to get access to many of the important functions of the [postgraduate-funding.com](https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/) website.
To do so, all you need to do is go to [www.postgraduate-funding.com/gateway](https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/gateway), and under the green ‘register’ box, put in your CU email that you have access to (e.g. XXXYYYZZZ@coventry.ac.uk or AAABBBCCC@uni.coventry.ac.uk). Within a few hours, you will be sent an email with your password.

Once logged in you will have access to all of the features of the website, which will be included as part of the following sections.

## Introducing Alternative Funders

As well as some of the major funders in the research world (e.g. NIHR, ESRC) there are over 1,000 charities, foundations and charitable trusts that can offer funding for researchers. These funders can offer anything between £100 - £10,000. And this money can be for things ranging from travel for research or conferences, research equipment expenses, fees, maintenance or other misc. things.
One thing to note about these charities is that they are incredibly varied.

Some are eccentric and specific (only giving money to those with specific surnames, such as Scottish Clan charities, or only giving to those who have a parent who was a grocer!), while others are far more generic (for those under 25 or for being a woman in STEM etc.). Don’t forget, some organisations or industry bodies are also options for funding. Not just charities.

Due to this diversity, each PGR will have their own unique list of charities and foundations that would apply to their specific research topics, where they live, their age, their gender, their familial heritage etc. There is no single best list of funders.

## Finding Funding Sources

### Approach methods

Before you get started on knowing which funders you wish to look for, first you need to think about what it is you are seeking and how much time you wish to invest. There are 2 major approaches that you can take to getting funding:

1.	The **Industrial** Approach

The **industrial** approach, is named because you will treat this stage like a worker in a factory. Your intent here is to create a wide net of funders you may have an interest in. This means you will have a large number of letters of interest/applications (a spreadsheet may come in handy!).

The _*upside*_ of taking this approach is you are more likely to get more money doing this. Also, after a while, you end up needing to put in less effort per application, as much of what you’ve written in 3-4 of your applications can be repurposed for other applications for similar charities.

The _*downside*_ to this is that it is a very big time commitment. While each application will take you less time, on average, you will still be making a large number of applications.  2 days each for 3 applications (6 days) is still less than 1 day each for 10 applications (10 days). Moreover, with this wider net, there will be many dead-ends, so a large amount of ‘wasted’ time.
The industrial approach is likely best suited to those who need a lot of money, for all sorts of things – e.g. fees (for those not fully-funded), maintenance (for those who have had a change in circumstances, or not funded) etc.

2.	The **Targeted** Approach

The **targeted** approach, is fairly transparent in its name. Your intent here is to find funders who you feel are appropriate for your exact needs. This means you will spend some time filtering out funders who aren’t appropriate, but will end up with some key funders.

The _*upside*_ of taking this approach is you are more likely to succeed in any specific application. A lot of funders who clearly fund things linked to your work are more likely to fund you than someone applying on the off chance via the wide-net approach.  This also means that you are more time efficient if you need specific funding, due to higher success rates.

The _*downside*_ to this is that less money overall is likely to come out of the applications. Also, with specific funders, you may miss out on some of the more eccentric and obscure funders that would have otherwise funded you when using a wider net to find funders.
The targeted approach is likely best suited to those who money for something specific, like a conference travel grant or research equipment fund. Usually with this method you are going to get no more that £4,000 in total. This is also better-suited to those with less time to spend on writing many applications.

### Creating a Rough List
Okay, so now you have your approach worked out, you need to actually start working on a list.
The first step is to create an over-arching list based on multiple resources:
Of course, there is the website [postgraduate-funding.com](https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/), mentioned above. On this site, a huge database of about 1,000 charities (and growing) are on there, with many tools helping you narrow down your search to tailor it to you in a 2-step process.

However, there are many more resources that can be used to locate potential funders:

* Online:
If looking for PhD studentships (as an MRes) going to [postgraduatestudentships.co.uk](https://www.postgraduatestudentships.co.uk/)  is well worth your time. A direct competitor to Luke’s website is [postgraduatefunding.com](https://www.postgraduatefunding.com/). A very similar address, just without the hyphen. [Unigrants](https://www.unigrants.co.uk) is also a research where you may find things.

* Offline:
We mustn’t forget the usefulness of libraries and librarians in helping to find funding. Librarians often have their fingers on the pulse of local charities and regional charities that could be prepared to fund a student’s travel, research or maintenance. Asking these people is one way of finding those that don’t have an online presence. Or, at least not one where they are obviously offering funding. As this is less clear, if you are only 1 of 2 or 3 people applying, you are far more likely to get funding than applying for funding that is being competed for by 50-100 people.

Moreover, there are published resources that can be used, such as [The Grants Register 2019](https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781349958092), which many libraries (non-academic) should carry.
Learned Societies:

As well as charities, specific learned societies (or even sub-groups within them) may provide funding for members for travel/research equipment.

## Initial Approach
So, you’ve made your list… now what?

The main take-away from the workshop that I got was that a charity is unlikely to award you money if you simply just apply. The best way to ensure you are going to get money (and not waste any of your precious time) is to send a letter of intent first. This letter of intent can come in email form, or in “snail mail” form. Remember, many charities still operate using the latter!

In this letter of intent, you should include:
*	What you are (PhD/MRes etc) and what you study.
*	What stage you are at
*	Brief explanation of the type of funds needed/what it would be used for
*	Asking for the charity’s eligibility criteria, deadlines and how one should apply.
*	If using ‘snail mail’ enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope

Beware, this is the stage where you will lose most of the funders – either they will not respond to an email, or they will say you are not eligible, you’ve missed deadlines, or they are not funding students at this time.
However, some will enclose application forms. If you have got to this stage – you’re in with a very good chance!

## Application.

Making a good application involves writing a strong personal statement. But what makes a strong personal statement? Here are some quick pointers

*	Wider implications of your research. The “So what?” aspect. Why should they fund you – what would be the benefit to the wider society
*	Is it interesting? Finding a cure for cancer is self-evidently interesting, but your research may be more theoretical or obscure. Explaining, concisely, why it is interesting to them and others is vital.
*	Provide experience of past funding – the fact you have won a full studentship (aka a scholarship) is a boon, not a detriment to your applications.
*	Make subtle allusions to their mission (but don’t lay this on too thick!)
*	Brevity
*	Provide a financial statement.
*	Supervisor Reference – So they know you are real!

### Financial statement

A financial statement is needed to show the funders that you have considered why you need the funding and how you will use it. Example ones can be found on [postgraduate-funding.com](https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/) once logged in.

# Concluding remarks

After reading this, you should now notice that there are a vast number of funding sources for PGRs. The come in many forms for many different needs and CU has provided us access to a great resource to access this funding.

This piece was longer than I intended it to be, but I think getting this information out to other PGRs is worth it. Hopefully others find it as useful as I found going to the class.
