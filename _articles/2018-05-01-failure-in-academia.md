title: Stepping out of the Shadow of Failure
subtitle: James Bartlett talks about imposter syndrome, and how opening up about failure can create more realistic expectations of academia.
---

Browse any guide on postgraduate research and you will come across how emotionally challenging a Master’s and PhD can be. For example, [Kate Williams](http://www.psypag.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/30th-Anniversary-Book.pdf) outlined the challenges and isolation that you can face in the PsyPAG survival guide (page 31). She also touches on what is known as “imposter syndrome”. This is the feeling that you are a failure or a fraud in comparison to your peers. As always, there is an excellent PhD comic ("Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham
www.phdcomics.com) to illustrate this!

Now, you could probably do a whole PhD on the causes of imposter syndrome, but this thinkpiece is about survival bias. This is a persistent cognitive bias that leads us to concentrate on things that we can observe, whilst neglecting the possibility of things that we cannot observe. An illustrative example of this was in trying to work out how to improve the protection of fighter planes during the second world war. The engineers wanted to focus on reinforcing the areas that had received the most damage, but this is based on faulty logic. As these bullet-ridden planes were the ones that made it back, the damage that they suffered was clearly not crucial to their functioning as they survived the flight home! The areas that needed protecting the most could only be found on the planes that had been shot down, meaning the engineers could not look at those. Another context to think about this in, which will help demonstrate how this type of thinking is illogical, is when someone wins the lottery. When you see them win, do you think you have a good chance of winning too simply by buying a ticket? . However, this is neglecting the millions of people who bought a ticket and didn’t win, as you only see the winner. In a gambling context, the survival bias is more visible. On the other hand, in the realm of education, it is not so clear.

You can think of these two previous examples as analogies to the life of a research student. All you hear about are people’s successes. If you’re accepted onto a PhD programme or get offered a job, you would shout about it and celebrate. However, failure makes you feel, for lack of a better term, shit. You don’t tell everyone you see that you didn’t get the job. Like the planes sitting at the bottom of the ocean, the only results you see are people's successes. Returning to imposter syndrome, if you only see the successes people experience, when you experience failure, you think it is down to your inadequacies and feel like a failure in comparison to your "more successful" peers. However, what you’re looking at are the planes that returned to base. More great examples of this can be found in Veronika Cheplygina’s blog series on “[How I fail](http://www.veronikach.com/category/how-i-fail/)”, where she interviews different researchers from different fields and career stages on their experience of success and failure. However, this may seem a bit impersonal, so I will share my experiences of failure and include a quick poll of the other members of the PGR newsletter team.

When I was applying for PhDs, I didn’t submit a lot of applications as I was only interested in specific topics. I applied for two PhDs, had one interview and one place, a 50% success rate. The unsuccessful application was for my dream university, and not even making it to the interview stage felt truly soul destroying. Although I am happy where I am now, it was the first big failure I experienced, and I struggled for motivation weeks after hearing back. In the hunt for academic jobs, I have applied for six, had two interviews, and no successes, a 0% success rate. Not getting the job after what feels like a good interview feels worse than not reaching the interview stage. The dejection of getting so close to a job I’ve been training six years for then starts to impact my current work as I ruminate about what I could have done better. Despite telling a few people in person I did not make the cut in all these situations, I did not post the rejections on social media, but I know I would if I got them. Therefore, without writing this, most people would be none the wiser.

Extending this across the whole newsletter team for a larger sample, we have had a 44% success rate at getting an interview, and a 25% success rate at getting a PhD place. For academic jobs, we have had a 53% and 27% success rate for getting an interview and a job respectively. This shows that for both PhDs and academic jobs, we have experienced more failure than success at getting the positions.

Hopefully this thinkpiece will allow you to see that, despite not wanting to openly talk about it, most of us have experienced our fair share of failure. Usually more often than we’ve succeeded! Therefore, the next time you do not get a job, or a paper accepted, try not to think that you are an imposter. Do not get me wrong, failure hurts and it will not stop hurting, but think about how you can bounce back from it and succeed next time. We have all failed at some point, we just don’t want to talk about it. Maybe if we could all talk about it more openly, we would have more accurate expectations.

One way we could do this is by including a commiserations section along with our good news. You could let us know if you applied for a job or tried submitting a paper, but did not quite make it this time. This could be one way in which we see a more realistic outlook on the life of a research student. Do you think this would be a good idea? Please respond to our poll below if you would be interested in seeing this section as a part of the PGR newsletter.

*[James Bartlett](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/researchers/james-bartlett/) is a third year psychology PhD student in the [Brain, Belief, and Behaviour Lab](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/advances-in-behavioural-science/brain-belief-and-behaviour-research/). His research focuses on the neurocognitive mechanisms associated with nicotine dependence and shouts a lot about research methods and statistics in psychology.*
