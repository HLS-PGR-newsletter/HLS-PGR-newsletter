title: Stress while doing a Research Degree
subtitle: What ways can Coventry University students deal with stress?
---


## Background
Whenever you do a degree, there are stresses that come with it. Meeting deadlines, large workloads, and the constant feeling of “I could be doing more right now” even at 11pm on a Friday night. These feelings are not only more intense when doing a PhD or MRes, but more stress can be found in realising that many of the problems you run into don’t have obvious answers that a lecturer can help with, but that must be found out by yourself.
Of course, an MRes comes with different stressors than a PhD. To finish a full research project in a year can be a big ask. Conversely, a PhD is a huge undertaking. Both kinds of research degrees come with their own unique set of stressors. However, one thing is common – they _**do**_ have stressors.
If you’re reading this piece, it means you’re a PGR and this is not exactly news to you. However, dealing with stress during your time at CU is vital to both keeping on top of your studies and, more importantly, your own mental health.
It is so important, in fact, that this is not our first time visiting this topic. In our first issue, released in March earlier this year, we put out a [short piece](https://hls-pgr-newsletter.github.io/HLS-PGR-newsletter.github.io/_health-wellbeing/18-02-23-Dealing_with_Stress.html) with 6 short tips on how to best avoid or deal with some of the stressors that come up during the course of your research degree. Those short tips were useful, but somewhat vague. As a result, we at the PGR Newsletter thought it would be a good idea to cover it in more detail here.

## Why should we deal with Stress?
Stress is the body’s natural response to novel situations. When we evolved, it was useful to stress about certain things, as stress prompts actions, and short-term, small levels of stress may improve levels of performance in various domains (Yerkes Dodoson, 1908; Hebb, 1955). In the literature, this type of stress is referred to as ‘acute stress’. However, humans did not evolve to live in modern society. As a result, the situations we currently place ourselves in cause us to stress in high levels, for long periods of time, quite routinely. This is called ‘chronic’ stress.
Chronic stress has become a significant problem around the world (Milczarek, Schneider & Gonzalez, 2009). Research suggests that this kind of stress can affect both physical and mental health – In terms of physical health, it is found to be associated with autoimmune diseases (Smallwood et al., 2018), obesity (Tomiyama, 2018) and hyperalgesia (increased pain perception; Zheng et al., 2015; Hong, Zheng & Wiley, 2015, to name a few. Chronic stress is also thought to be the basis for many mental health issues (Howes et al., 2017), especially depression (Slavich & Irwin, 2014). All this information comes in at the same time as articles about the effect of [post-graduate research on mental health](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/576769/) become more prevalent.

As a result, it is important that we have ways of dealing with and lowering levels of stress.

## How Can PGRs lower stress in Coventry.
Dealing with stress can be different for each person. For some, it can mean reading a non-academic book, or watching some TV. For others it can be to listen to music or go to a live concert. For many others, it can be playing a sport, instrument or taking part in another hobby as an outlet. Below we will list some things that you can do to help with stress here in Coventry.

### Art Therapy – Arty Folks
Art therapy has taken off in popularity the last 20 years, and a recent meta-analysis noted that 4/5 studies show improvement of stress management and stress prevention when using Art Therapy (Martin et al., 2018), which provides clear evidence that it works.

 As well as her [blog post](http://www.laurawilde.co.uk/dealing-with-stress-and-feeling-overwhelmed-during-a-phd/) on how to deal with stress, Laura Wilde has just written a great [blog post on her website](http://www.laurawilde.co.uk/the-art-of-relaxation-with-arty-folks/) about a new initiative in Coventry called Arty Folks. [Arty Folks](http://arty-folks.co.uk/wp/) is an art group, and community that work to help those struggling with daily stress and mental health issues using art. They offer [weekly groups](http://arty-folks.co.uk/wp/we-offer/gallery/) every Wednesday between 12:30 and 14:30pm.

Their work in the Coventry area is helping many, and they are welcoming to new faces.

### Mindfullness – The Flame

There is a growing body of research that suggests that mindfulness-based methods work well at reducing stress (Khoury et al., 2015). In Coventry City Centre, [The Flame](https://www.the-flame.co.uk/) offers mindfulness courses and various avenues to help yourself destress using meditation should you find it useful.

### Music

For many people, listening to music can help reduce stress. (Linnemann, Strahler & Nater, 2017)
Music does seem to have a positive effect on levels of depression symptoms, (Moradipanah, Mohammadi & Mohammadil, 2009). Castillo-Péretz and colleagues (Castillo-Péretz et al., 2010) found that music therapy had a significantly better rate of improvement than regular psychotherapy, even! This has even been found in randomised control trials (Albornoz, 2011; Erkkilä et al., 2011).
If you like music, take the time to use free streaming services to listen to it. You can also take the time to visit the [Coventry Music Museum]( http://www.covmm.co.uk/). [Coventry Music Hub](http://www.coventrymusichub.co.uk/groupsandchoirs) also have a list of music groups and choirs that you can join should you want to find groups of friends who perform with you.
