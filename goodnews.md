On this page we will try and keep an up-to-date list of all the achievements made by HLS post-graduates. From PRP passes and competition wins, to publications and press releases, we will collate a list here for you all.

Even if you have some non-research based good news (Passed a test? Competed in a music or sport event?), let us know and people can see what else our post-graduates have been up to! Email [Jenny Mackay](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+goodnews@gmail.com) to add any good news to the list.
