subtitle: We are always on the look out for participants, why not take part in one of your fellow post-grad's studies?

On this page, we will be hosting information and links for people to advertise their studies, in case they are in need of extra participants. This can be in the form of a survey link, a participant sign-up form, or just some information about the study with researcher contact information. Let us know if you have any studies you want added to this by addressing an email to [James Bartlett](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+researchptps@gmail.com) at cov.pgrnewsletter+researchptps@gmail.com.

### Important information

* If you would like your study to be hosted on this website, you **must**  mention this method of distribution of the study in your ethics application. Coventry Ethics have been made aware of our website and are happy for you to do so, provided you include it in the application. If you have already applied for ethics/got ethical approval then all you need to do is make an amendment with Coventry Ethics. This process is usually quick and painless.


* If you have done the above and want your study advertised, you need to provide the following information:
- Study title
- Study topic
- Researcher
- Inclusion criteria (are you looking for particular kinds of participants?)
- Study type (face to face or online)
- Estimated study length
- Survey link or contact information
- Ethical approval reference
- Closing date of study
