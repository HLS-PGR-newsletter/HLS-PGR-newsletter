# Research Tips: Your first Month


**1 -**	Attend all introductory sessions and workshops

•	These sessions will give you vital information on who’s who at the university, the requirements of your program and support systems the University offers

**2 -** 	Learn who’s who at the University

•	It is important to know who to talk to about supports, workshops, conferences and any issues that you may have during your degree

**3 -**	Learn to use a reference software

•	Maintaining easily accessible and organized references will save you hours of formatting and stress when putting your documents together. Take the time to become fully competent with a software of your choice and you will never regret it! The University show you how to use one in  the workshops

**4 -**	Organize your computer desktop, create folders for each section of your thesis

•	In order to maintain a sense of control over your work, try organizing and maintaining your desktop in a way that suits you. Things will be easier to find and you won’t feel as stressed looking at your computer

**5 -**	Learn how to use Microsoft word and how it can help you managing large documents

•	Word has many features that most people don’t know about! The University offers a workshop on managing large documents. I would advise attending and taking the time to fully understand word. Setting up your document before starting to write will ease editing and prevent having to go back and formatting later.

**6 -**	Make friends

•	Doing an MRes or PhD can be an isolating experience. Although there are many others doing the same degree, nobody is doing the same topic. It is easy to get lost in your work and lose perspective. Make friends and keep talking to them to reduce stress, maintain perspective and remind yourself there is more to life than your degree

**7 -**	Be social

•	It is easy to get into a routine of rolling out of bed, staying in your pj’s and working from your room. While this may be appropriate for some periods such as writing weeks; it is essential to leave the house and interact with people to maintain good mental health.

**8 -**	Exercise

•	MRes and PhD work is very mentally tiring but what about your body? Your body needs to be exercised to! To maintain good physical health, exercise is essential. It also reduces stress, anxiety, depression and improves sleep; all good things during your degree! There are lots of competitive and for-fun sports teams you can join at Coventry University; as well as 2 gyms beside the university. Coventry also has many parks if you fancy a stroll



# Reflection
The importance of creating and maintaining a social support network during your MRes or PhD cannot be underestimated. Although there are many students doing MRes’s and PhDs at Coventry; nobody else is doing exactly the same topic, which can lead to feelings of isolation as students move through their degrees at different paces and use different methods. It’s easy to work from home during your degree as you’re not required to be ‘at work’. While there are times that staying at home is beneficial; such as writing weeks; the decreased social interaction can have a negative effect on your health. Depending on whether you live on your own, with flatmates or family; it can be a slippery slope from working at home, to not getting dressed, to not showering and not leaving the house for days with only Frankie the spider to talk to. Not having social interaction can lead to tunnel vision regarding your degree and you can forget that you are not only a student, but a person with friends, family and hobbies as well.

Whether it’s by coming into the student offices to work, meeting people for coffee, joining a society or club, or going to the gym, it’s vitally important to create and maintain a social network during your degree. While other students aren’t doing exactly what you’re doing topic wise, they are completing similar degrees; at the end of the day everyone will have the same chapters in their theses. Meeting and discussing issues or newfound knowledge with other students will strengthen your ability to defend your work, or clear up confusion about topics. You might find a better method to use for data collection, or a paper that explains your theoretical framework perfectly.

But life isn’t all about your degree. The friends you make will support you in the other areas of your life, such as feeling homesick if you’ve moved away, after work drinks on a Friday to de-stress after a week of work, keeping you motivated when you have bad days and question for the thousandth time why you’re doing this degree, motivating you to exercise, and of course, being there to listen. Doing an MRes or PhD is a great life decision, ensure it goes as smoothly as possible by surrounding yourself with friends who will push you over the finish line!
