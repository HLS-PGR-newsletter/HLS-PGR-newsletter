title: Balancing a job and PhD
subtitle: A reflection from James Bartlett

# Background

The typical story for a PhD student is that you get three years’ worth of funding to concentrate on your research and write a thesis. However, for one reason or another, many graduate students balance their PhD with another job. This may be because you are doing a professional doctorate, you need extra money for living costs, or you just may not have funding but still want to do a PhD. For me, it was the latter. I applied for some funded PhDs, but I was not successful. I was inpatient and did not want to wait around for the next round of PhDs to come up. Therefore, I stayed at Coventry and started a PhD with just my fees covered.

## Job history

Like the majority of PhD students, throughout my degree I have worked as an hourly paid lecturer and demonstrator. However, you do not get enough hours or job security for this to support living expenses, such as a house and bills throughout the summer. Throughout my PhD, I had to work several jobs in addition to my hourly paid teaching work. For the first two years of my PhD, I was studying full time and worked around 25 hours in a Wetherspoons. This was great for my PhD as I was able to concentrate on reading and writing during the day, and then head off to work the night shift. However, finishing at 3am for successive days would mean I just crashed when it got to the weekend. I was also struggling financially as working 25 hours a week in a Wetherspoons was not the most lucrative job. Therefore, at the end of my second year, I decided to cut my PhD down to part-time as it was just not sustainable. I got a new job at Aldi which was better pay, but my shifts were always early mornings, so I was only able to be at the university two days per week. For an experimental psychology project, this was not ideal as I was only able to collect a limited amount of data per week. Then came job number three. At the end of my third year, I finally managed to get a full-time academic job as a psychology technician at Arden University. This has been the best thing to happen to me as I finally got the chance to focus on a job I had been training for. Despite the positives, I can only come to the university two half days per week to collect data. As I am in what should be my final year as a PhD student, I have begun to reflect on the challenges and positives of balancing a job and a PhD.  


## Challenges

The biggest challenges for me have been fatigue and motivation. For the two years that I worked in a Wetherspoons, I had the time to focus on my PhD, but I did not have a lot of money and I had to work throughout the night for half of the week. For me, this was just not sustainable. Fatigue also played a part when I worked at Aldi. Rather than finishing work at 3am, I had to wake up at 3am to start the morning shift. This meant that rather than crashing at the weekend, I would just be too tired to focus on my PhD when I got home from work, even though I would have the rest of the afternoon and evening. As most PhD students know, one of the most difficult parts of completing a PhD is keeping motivated. When I was working a lot and not being able to make progress on my PhD, it would make me feel like I would never get anywhere, and I would be stuck working in a supermarket for the rest of my life. This is not to say it can’t be a fulfilling job to some people, but it was far away from what I wanted to do with my time. There have been two periods where I seriously thought about quitting the PhD from because of low motivation, but both times I convinced myself that I should stick with it.    

## Positives

The main positives of working alongside my PhD have been during my short time as a psychology technician. I have been able to put into practice everything I have learnt throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate degree and feel like I am making a difference. In contrast to the hourly paid teaching work, I have full responsibility in getting the work done. This has been really important for my motivation as rather than feeling like my job prospects are slipping away, I have been able to see I can be a valuable member of a psychology department. Although it does not sound like I am too positive about my experience working at Aldi and Wetherspoons, both jobs have been incredibly humbling experiences. I have worked with people who have never attended university, so I have developed how I explain what I do as a PhD student in order for the layperson to understand. I also have a real sense of appreciation for finally getting the job I want to do. This has also been key for staying motivated as I felt like all the hard work and patience finally came off.  

## Reflecting back on my experiences

Like most graduate students, as I come to the end of my PhD, I have started to reflect on my time. Because of how difficult I found it at times, I often ask myself whether I made a huge mistake in taking the fees only PhD position. Although I like to complain about it, I do not think I would change anything. Balancing a job and a PhD has taught me some valuable lessons, and I am finally starting to see the rewards of persevering with it.
