title: What to expect during your Research Degree.
subtitle: Another reflection from Becky Seymour
---



Starting your MRes or Ph.D. can be overwhelming. Whether you've moved to a new city and set up a new life, or are staying at the same university you did your undergrad in; there are many differences between undergraduate and graduate level education. In this reflection I wanted to highlight 3 things you should expect to feel in the first few weeks (or longer) when starting your new degree.

**1)** Expect to feel out of place

If you've moved to a new university try to remember how you felt in the first few weeks of your first year. You may have moved into residence or a house, have no clue where the nearest shops are and feel not at home. Now also remember how you felt at the end of your undergrad when you knew where everything was and felt comfortable; this feeling will come again. Moving to a new city and university is challenging. Each university has its own way of doing things - you will learn them and get used to it. Ask questions if you want answers and embrace the nervous excitement of starting a new chapter of your education ðŸ˜Š

**2)** Expect to feel overwhelmed

The first few weeks are challenging. You complete orientation, meet your supervisor and stare at all the checklists not having a clue about where to start. It's OK. Everybody is feeling the same. Take some deep breathes and remember Rome wasn't built in a day. You have time and support to complete your degree. In the first few weeks focus on settling in and coming up with a plan for the first few months. Making friends and talking about how you're feeling will help you to see everyone is feeling the same way.

**3)** Expect to feel like a fraud

In the first few weeks of your degree as you go through orientation and making a plan of action, you might start feeling like a fraud. Being a postgraduate feels different because it is different. You are more mature, the work is more specialised, and a higher level of thinking is required compared to your undergrad. You have gone from expert in your undergrad to novice in your postgrad.  Feeling like you shouldn't be sitting next to researchers in an office, or that you know nothing about anything can, and does, happen. Don't be alarmed; this is normal. If this happens, try to remember all you have accomplished to get to where you are. You are capable, intelligent and driven (otherwise you wouldn't be here). You are at the beginning of a degree; you're only supposed to be an expert at the end, give yourself time to learn.


These 3 common feelings might occur throughout your degree. Embrace them, it means you're taking chances, learning new things and progressing! As Voltaire said:

"The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing"
