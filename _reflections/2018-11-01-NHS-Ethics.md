title: Getting NHS Ethics Approval
subtitle: A 'how-to' guide, and reflection by Becky Seymour

# Background

As research students, we all need to go through ethical approval at the university. However, some students here will also be conducting research that requires NHS ethics approval. There is very little advice out there on how exactly to go about NHS ethics, or what challenges one might expect. As a result, Becky Seymour, a PhD research student in nursing, speaks below both about how to go about getting ethical approval from the NHS, and then follows up by reflecting on her experence.

# How To
This post discusses the process of completing NHS ethics and my experience of that process. This applies to applications that need a full-review and deal with sensitive issues. Partial review or less sensitive issues may only include some of these steps, not all of them.


## The nitty-gritty: what you need to do
1.	Get a research passport for all NHS sites you will be using
2.	Receive site support and approval
3.	IRAS (Integrated Research Application System) approval


### 0)	Complete Coventry University Ethics:

Before anything happens at all on the NHS ethics application, you will need to get CU ethics approval. This is a process that can take time (depending on the time of year) and may get pushed back for corrections if the ethics team are not happy with everything. This part of the process is the same as for any other PhD student. Only, for those having to do an NHS ethics application, it is just the start.

### 1)	Research Passport:

To conduct research at an NHS site you need a research passport. The research passport requires a DBS police check (Coventry University will help you with the forms and pay for your first one). DBS checks last one year, so it is wise to pay the yearly fee to keep it active as your research may last longer then a year and the University will only pay for one. To do this you will have to go to the [update service website](https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/crsc/apply?execution=e1s1) and enter all the relevant details.
There is also a form to complete and have signed by your supervisor and research lead. After this form has been submitted you may be contacted by occupational health at your primary NHS site. If you need to be in contact with patients or staff, you will need to meet with a nurse and show them your vaccine record. If you cannot prove what vaccines you have had, you will need to get a blood check or get vaccinations updated. After these three steps have been completed you will be given your research passport, which is a form. Be wary, the NHS doesn’t always know which department to send the research passport form to, as they do not know the way the university is structured. If it has been over 3 weeks since getting approval, and you still have not received the form, then contact them to confirm which department it was sent to.

### 2) NHS Site support:

Although receiving site approval will only come once IRAS approval has been achieved, it is important to contact the research office at the NHS site you are planning on using to seek their support and approval for the research. If you need any resources or staff time, these are the people who will approve it, so there’s no point getting IRAS approval without having site support! Most likely your supervisor will know who to contact. Introduce yourself and your research and request a phone call or meeting to discuss what access you can have. This may influence your research protocol so be sure to seek site support before completing your IRAS.

### 3a) Completing IRAS form:

Go to [their website](https://www.myresearchproject.org.uk/) and create an account. Follow the prompts to make a new project and complete the screening questions, these will tell you whether you need a full or partial review. After the screening questions, complete the application and attach supporting documents. This is a time-consuming process chock-full of repetition. But this repetition will ensure you are very clear on your methods and justifications for the study. Ensure you write the application as if it is going to be read by a 5-year old with *NO* PRIOR KNOWLAGE OF ANYTHING in your subject area! Ethics committees are made up of volunteers who may or may not have even heard of the topic you’re discussing. As a result, you have to make it as easy as possible for them to read and understand what it is you’re doing, and why you have to do it. Something that may seem incredibly obvious to you could be something they don’t understand at all. When ready, click submit and notifications will be sent to all listed supervisors and the Coventry University designated sponsor (currently Professor **Olivier Sparagano**, Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor (PVC)). It is a good idea to have received Coventry Ethics approval before submitting your IRAS application as then you can attach the approval as an attachment to encourage a good opinion. When all supervisors and the Coventry sponsor have signed off, you call the central booking office and set a **panel review date** (see next point). When this has been done, the booking office will give you a ‘P’ number. NOTE: THIS IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN CHANGE ON THE APPLICATION WITHOUT RESTARTING THE PROCESS! If you change *anything* else, all signatures will be erased, and you will need to submit the application for signatures again. Fill in the number (on one of the first pages) and click submit.

### 3b)	Attending the IRAS review panel:

arrive early, dress to impress. Preferably go with a supervisor who has been through the process before. They can be large panels and might be intimidating alone. It is also good to have someone else’s perspective on how the panel review went. After the panel review you will have a response within 10 working days. Either a full approval (rare), amendments (most common), or rejection. Amendments can be made and resubmitted to the same panel. Rejections will need to be edited and go through the booking office and review panel again. Along with your IRAS attachments will be two documents about your research schedule and needs from the NHS site. Once the site receives your approval they will ensure they can and are willing to meet your requirements and give site approval. Once you have your research passport, your IRAS and site approval, you are ready to go be a researcher!


# Reflecting on going through NHS ethics:

My ethics experience has been long and painful. It started out well with CU ethics approval and very positive feedback about my methods and “overall well-thought-out study”. With this positive feedback we completed the research passport and got site approval pending IRAS approval. We submitted IRAS and attended a general panel. Although I’m doing a qualitative study and could have gone to a qualitative panel, we decided a general panel would be fine and as it was meeting much sooner it worked better for the timing. I attended the panel with my DOS and it was very intimidating. You are called into a room where a group of people (I had 12) are sitting around a table. I immediately felt judged and steeled myself for an unpleasant meeting. Unfortunately, I was right. The questions reflected a complete misunderstanding of the population and what the research was trying to achieve. After the meeting my DOS and I had a debrief and prepared for many amendments. When I received a full rejection, the team was shocked. For me, this quickly turned to anger when I read why they had rejected the application. In my opinion the panel had made baseless assumptions about the FGM population (the population that my research is focused on), caused by a complete lack of knowledge and reliance on negative stereotypes. The information I had included in the justification section of the application clearly was not enough. The panel also called into question my ability as a researcher to deal with such a sensitive topic.  

The rejection was a massive setback to the project timeline and me as a PhD student. It was a solid blow to my confidence and was worrying and infuriating at the same time as even though CU ethics and my team had approved the application, I now needed to redo the application to suit the review panel (none of them researchers). The edits took months to complete as my team and I wanted to ensure a clear approval for the next submission and so everybody went through the application with a fine-tooth comb. It was a frustrating, stressful, and demotivating experience. But it was also thought-provoking, reflection-causing, and – in a strange way - motivating. The lack of knowledge and baseless assumptions made regarding the population astounded me, but the motivation came from it reminding me how knowledgeable I have become during the PhD, and how I need to improve my communication skills to lay people. It also made me aware of what most people’s views of the population were, and how my research is needed to increase the knowledge out there. We submitted the new application to a qualitative panel. Attending the panel a 2nd time was nerve wracking and, again, the questions were tough. When I walked out I couldn’t say whether it would be approved or not. It was approved pending amendments. One of which was English speaking only women would be allowed to participate. This was a major set-back and, in my opinion, an inappropriate request again based on assumptions about the population. From discussions with the lead midwife of the clinic, we knew most of the women attending did speak English. But, limiting ourselves in recruitment and limiting the data to only women who could speak English was not ideal. It presents a limitation in the study, which no student wants to have more of than they need. Unfortunately, to get approval I had to bend over. I felt powerless and angry, and often still do when I think about this stipulation. However, anger is a surprisingly good motivator, and it has provided me with energy to complete my research to give me an opportunity to complete a further study including women who speak any language once the PhD is finished. From start to finish, the IRAS approval took 5 months. We had scheduled 2 months. A 3-month delay is tough for any research student to deal with. However, as students, we must learn to roll with the punches and just keep slogging away. If we give up, all the effort was for naught – and I am not letting all this effort go to waste!

My advice is, if possible, **avoid NHS ethics**. If you do need to use the NHS, conduct research using NHS staff as opposed to patients. This is because other students have had much more success when using staff over patients. If you must use the NHS to recruit patients, assume the reader of the application knows nothing. And, when I say nothing, I mean **nothing**. Use simple, clear language to justify the research and to describe the methods. Run the application by a non-academic to see if the language is suitable, and to see if they come to any misunderstandings so that you can pre-empt such a situation.
One last thing for those of you doing NHS ethics applications: Good luck!
