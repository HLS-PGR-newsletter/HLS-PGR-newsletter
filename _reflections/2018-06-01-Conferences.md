## Background
Part of doing a research degree involves producing work that will likely require you to present at conferences. In this piece, Phillipa Carr talks about her experiences of going to conferences and provides some helpful advice on what you can do.

Conferences are a key part of academic life providing an opportunity to make new contacts, share your research and receive feedback.  Like most parts of PhD life, they can be a daunting experience at first.  However, you will find your own way of surviving the conference experience and most importantly, having a good time.  I have reflected on my conference experiences to date and discuss the things I would have liked to know as a nervous first year about to go to my first conference.

## Preparing

So, you have registered for a conference what do you do next?  When preparing your presentation, I have found it helpful to reflect on the type of conference:  are you presenting to a specialist or general audience?  Looking at the programme and the research being presented during your session can also be useful when preparing.  For example, when presenting after someone who uses the same methodological approach, I was not required to go into a lengthy explanation of my own methodology.  I could refer to the previous presenters talk and this gave me valuable time I could use to discuss the implications of my research in more depth.  There’s no point in boring your audience with repetitive information when you have interesting results to share.  

## At the conference

Networking can result in you gaining ‘academic friends’.  So, get on social media, use the conference hashtag and find out who will be there.  The conference programme can be a useful resource too.  If your supervisor and research squad are also going, they can introduce you to people whose work you admire. Do not panic if you are going to the conference alone, in my experience, this can result in you meeting more people.  All you need to do is to be able to remember your name (the conference badge helps) and tell them about your research.  Stay calm and you will soon have new acquaintance and future collaborators.  You may even bump into them at future events and struggle to remember where you met them.  Business cards can be useful to help your contacts remember you but are not essential.  Designing business cards can be a productive form of procrastination helping you to feel like a ‘proper’ researcher.

	Finally, it’s time for you to stand by your poster or deliver your presentation.  It’s quite common to worry that people will dislike your work.  However, we do not go to conferences to dislike others research.  Your audience want to hear about your work and are interested in what you have to say.  So, ensure that your slides are legible and that you communicate clearly.  If you are with a colleague or new acquaintance, ask them to tweet a photo of your presentation to raise awareness of your work.  

Questions can be a cause for concern and an opportunity to reflect on your research.  I have learnt that it’s better to be receptive and to engage with questions than to appear defensive.  Sometimes, you can receive awkward questions that do not relate to the aim of your study.  You do not have to have a magic answer, it can be better to thank someone for their feedback or to offer to discuss the issue raised later.  On the other hand, questions can be very useful and may even be potential viva questions.  So, if you have someone with you, ask them to note the questions for you so that you can reflect on them later.  

## After the conference

	After returning home, I have found writing a conference review a great way of reflecting on my experience.  It allows you think of the conference themes and how the differing presentations intersect and the differing perspectives offered.  A conference review provides the opportunity to get more writing practice and to demonstrate your interest in publishing work.  A range of newsletters and journals provide opportunities to publish conference reviews including the [British Psychological Society West Midlands Branch Newsletter](https://www1.bps.org.uk/networks-and-communities/member-microsite/west-midlands-branch/publications) and the [Psychology Postgraduate Affairs Group (PsyPAG) Quarterly](http://www.psypag.co.uk/the-quarterly/).

	Most importantly, enjoy yourself!  You have worked hard to get your research done, had an abstract accepted and found some funding to cover your costs.  Conferences allow you to share your research with others and to find out about other approaches with people who have similar interests.
