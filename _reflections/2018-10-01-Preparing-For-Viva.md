title: Preparing For Your Thesis Defence
subtitle: A reflection from Diane Ménage

# Background

Hooray! On 4th September I passed my viva with minor amendments. The initial celebrations were accompanied by an overwhelming sense of relief. A couple of weeks on, it has actually sunk in now. I have since been reflecting on how I prepared for the viva and what turned out to be the most helpful activities. In an effort to help others as they approach their vivas, I have compiled my top tips.

# Tips 	

## Before Submitting

*	**Go to the CU PGR Workshop: Preparing for your Thesis**.

These workshops are run by the RECAP team and the HLS faculty. They only run a couple of times a year so look out for them, and book ahead.

*	**Arrange to have a mock viva**.

For those who are not moving to the new Framework (starting in September 2018), there is no mandatory pre-viva PRP. Even so, it is best that you have a mock viva to prepare you for the real thing, so it feels less alien to you when it comes to the real thing. Your DOS will arrange this if you give them enough time. They may do it themselves or they will find a suitable person/s. Discuss with your DOS before you submit to give enough time to plan this in.


*	**Arrange it so that as soon as you have submitted, you have a holiday**.

Once you’ve submitted and have the (minimum 6) weeks of waiting for the actual viva, the last thing you want to have is nothing but stressful prep to do. Instead, go away on holiday, or make sure you have time off from other activities if you are at home. Do not look at your thesis! Do what you find relaxing. Don’t read anything remotely connected to your thesis/research area. I highly recommend reading something funny. It all gets a bit serious and stressful in the run up to submission. Laughter is a great way to lift you out of it. Plus, this gives you something to work towards – a holiday can be a lovely reward for all the hard work leading up to submission.

## Between submission and the viva

*	**About a month before the viva, create a viva preparation timetable**.

Doing this made me feel more in control and stopped me panicking. I had a plan and it would be fine! I did something (no matter how small) every day so that I didn’t ‘break the chain’. Work out a plan that suits you and then commit to it. This will also keep you sane at a time when stress can very easily start to take over.

*	**Kick start your preparation by reading your whole thesis again**.

Okay, so you’re back from your short break after submitting? Now What? Be sure to re-read your thesis. You will find typos and mistakes that you never saw before. Don’t worry, make a note and these can be fixed after the viva. Concentrate on reading it thoroughly, summarising each paragraph to its essential meaning or key points. In this way summarise each chapter to 1-2 sides of A4. I found this a great way of understanding and appreciating the thesis as a coherent whole. It also illuminates weaker areas. These are areas to focus on because you may have to defend them. How could you make these areas stronger? What questions might be asked of you about them? Preparing for this in advance will make the defence go much smoother.

*	**Practice explaining the thesis in 3 minutes**

(the gist of it), 5 minutes (bit more detail), and 10 minutes (a clear summary). Some examiners invite students to start the viva with a summary of their PhD, so this is perfect preparation.

*	**Don’t just think what you would say. Say it out loud**.

At your viva you will be examined on what you have said not what you are thinking. Talk to everybody who will listen (this is what friends and family are for) and invite them to ask questions.  But also, just practice to yourself. I know it can feel daft, but it is necessary. Being able to talk freely and confidently about your thesis can take some getting used to, but is necessary to be fully prepared for the viva.

*	**Buy or borrow some viva cards**  

[Viva Cards](http://vivacards.co.uk/about-vivacards/) are a set of cards that have been designed to ask simple, broad questions that will let you focus your ideas about your thesis in preparation for your viva. They are great at preparing you for what examiners may ask. The PGR Office have some for loan. I stuck the questions on every door in the house. Every time I went to the kitchen cupboard, opened the fridge or sat on the loo, I had a question to practise.

## At the viva

*	**On the day**

wear something that you feel both good and comfortable in. Eat something light and nutritious before your viva and take some water in with you. (it could be a long viva, so having something that stops your throat getting too dry is a must!). Take a copy of your thesis in with you, too.

*	**During the viva**

Breathe! Listen carefully to the questions. Stop, and have a drink of water if you need a few seconds to think (another reason to bring in some water with you). If you are answering a question and you feel you may have digressed, a useful question is: “Have I answered your question?" That will allow the examiners to let you know if you have answered their question adequately. If you have, you can move on without rambling more, if you haven’t you can refocus your answer. Most of all, smile and show them that you enjoy the opportunity to have a deep and meaningful conversation with two academics who have read your work. It may very well be the most in-depth you ever get to have about a body of our you have spent 3+ years working towards. Treating it more as a fun, enjoyable conversation about something you know a lot about makes it feel less stressful than as an exam.
