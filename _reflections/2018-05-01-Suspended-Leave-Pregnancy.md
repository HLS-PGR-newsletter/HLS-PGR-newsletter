title: Suspended Leave due to Pregnancy.
subtitle: How pregnancy can cause changes to study plans, and what you can do. A reflection from Emma Hadfield
---

## Background
Doing a research degree of any kind is a serious undertaking. However, when doing a research degree life does not just stand still. Time passes, and life events happen. Some of these are positive and others negative. Either may end up meaning you require to take some time off of your studies to focus on the other aspects of your life. In this reflection piece, Emma Hadfield talks about her experience pregnancy and having a baby during her Ph.D.

## Before Leave

Having only completed five months of my first year as a PhD student, finding out I was pregnant with my second child was both a joyous and anxious occasion.  I was keen to ensure being pregnant would in no way hinder my passion and motivation to complete a first full year of studies.  When I felt comfortable to inform my supervisory team of my pregnancy, at just over a little 3 months pregnant, they were equally supportive and understanding.  My supervisory team ensured I had the right contact names to begin enquiring about the possibility of suspended leave and how this would impact upon my studentship and my length of enrolment onto the course.  

So, I continued with my data collection of my first study, the writing of my systematic review, and the ongoing enquiries into possible routes into and out of suspended leave.  My baby was due to be born in the September, which would have been my 2nd year enrolment phase.  As such, other options would need to be considered, and after many emails and discussions with my supervisory team and the PGRSU (as it was at the time), I was able to make an informed decision.  I had the opportunity of completing an early first year PRP (with successfully passing), after which I immediately began my period of suspended leave. I had largely completed my data collection (only the later months of pregnancy resulted in some discomfort of commuting to study locations) for my first study by the time of my PRP.  


## During Leave

Whilst on suspended leave, I was in receipt of the transcriptions for the interviews (which I had organised to be completed prior to my suspension).  As such, I was still able to be in receipt of updates of any progress with my study and my thesis in general.  It was not required of me to maintain contact with my supervisory team during my suspension leave, except to discuss any new personal circumstances which may impact upon my length of suspension.  

During my initial enquiries, I was advised that I would need to return at a standard University enrolment date, which for me fell suitably at the April term.  By this point, my baby was now nearly 8 months old, and I had begun to feel more comfortable leaving him in the care of family members, alongside his elder sister.  As such, returning to my studies didn’t feel stressful, or difficult, as my supervisory team continued to be very supportive.  I too, had upheld my passion and motivation to complete my course, and had already begun to review the work I had completed in my first year.  With this, I was able to attend my first supervisory team meeting with a plan of what actions needed to be taken to re-commence my study.


## Coming back to the Ph.D.
I must admit that being a full-time PhD student and a new mother (again) was not always plain sailing.  I learnt during my first year of studies to become ultra-organised, have a positive outlook and embrace any minor (or major!) setback that comes with the unique combination of studying and parenthood.  With the addition of a second child (who was still at quite a young age), I utilised these same skills to my advantage and ensured every moment spent on my studies would lead to something productive and useful for my thesis.  That isn’t to say that you shouldn’t fully embrace the life of a “student”, but that sometimes, prioritisation of tasks (inclusive of events and meetings) is key when demands on your time is limited.  It is also necessary to accept the fact that sometimes-working hours may be stretched into the early hours of the evening, due to unforeseen childcare issues or the other usual studying issues: lack of Internet connection (and other IT issues); delayed responses from key persons involved in studies impacting upon tasks; own illnesses, etc.  However, it is important to always remind yourself of why you began these studies in the first place, and if you have children, they undoubtedly become your hindrance (only at times!) and your motivation for succeeding.

I am now at the end of my second year, and cannot believe how quickly the time has flown, since I first started this course and since finding out about my pregnancy.  I am still thoroughly enjoying the course and would advise that anyone thinking about taking suspended leave, for whatever reason, should research all possible avenues.  I would also recommend keeping in contact with your supervisory team as regards personal circumstances is essential in ensuring an effective working relationship.  Equally, communication with your Centre for Research is paramount as regards to any changes in your programme of study, as they are always willing and able to help with any queries you may have.  Above all, don’t be disheartened if a change in personal circumstances results in spending time away from your studies, as your initial motivation for starting the course will remain with you.
