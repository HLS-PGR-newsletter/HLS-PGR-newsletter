title: Cross-Faculty Research Degrees
subtitle: A reflection from Molly Browne
---

# Background

No research degree is exactly like any other research degree. There are always going to be odd quirks or specific issues that can crop up for each topic and research project. This is even more true for those who do cross-faculty research (CFR).

In this reflection, Molly Browne will reflect on her experience with doing research across 2 faculties: Faculty of Arts and Humanities (FAH) and Health and Life Sciences (HLS).

# Finding Your Place

I am slowly getting used to the bewildered looks that people give me when I talk about my PhD, and that I’m based in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities (FAH). From my own experience and from talking to other cross-faculty PhD students, we regularly find ourselves trying to justify why we’re based in one faculty over another, and constantly feel a bit out of place and out of the loop. It took me a surprisingly long time to settle in when I moved to Coventry. I was in an office with such welcoming friendly people, but their PhD topics were so far from my own I felt out of my depth. They were great when I needed general PGR advice, or knowing who to go to for IT issues and access, but I missed the informal topical discussions with people in my own research area.

Looking back on my first year I formed great friendships in FAH particularly with two full-time PhD students who began at the same time as me. Between us, we span across the faculty with our projects but have been through the first year journey together. I’ve welcomed a completely different viewpoint on my work and have explored ideas I don’t think I would have done without them. My little research bubble has been forced to be that bit broader, and I really think that’s not a bad thing. It’s amazing as well how a discussion completely unrelated to my topic has sent my brain snowballing in a completely different direction.

Whilst I have certainly benefitted from meeting two great PhD students, I still do sometimes feel a bit lost in the general PhD life within the faculty. I haven’t attended a lot of the seminars or workshops for fear of not having a clue what people are talking about, and instantly being found out as the FAH fraudster. Equally, I’ve missed seminars and events that would have been more relevant in HLS. The main downside to my project being largely health-science based, but not sitting in the faculty I don’t have people around who are more familiar with my area of research to quickly get their opinion or ask a question to.

This academic year I became a faculty rep. After speaking with other students in FAH, as PGRs we span so many research areas everyone feels a bit on their own and out of the loop. Id’ like to try and increase support for cross-faculty students. Through becoming a rep I’ve met students in HLS who have pointed out useful events to go to and other people to chat to.

# Advice to others in CFR

My advice to other cross-faculty students is to **speak up**. Don’t be afraid to contact people outside of your faculty to ask what events or research is going on elsewhere. Get in touch with your PGR Senior Rep who will have the contacts of other faculty reps and could help you branch out into other faculties. It’s also okay to feel a bit out of place sometimes, and it doesn’t mean your research is any less valid or valuable than other research in the faculty. Try and view your circumstances as having a foot in the door of several faculties which can definitely benefit you and your research.
